# Ripple C Toolchain Documentation

## Overview

The Ripple C toolchain provides a complete compilation pipeline from C99 source code to Brainfuck, including:

- **rcc** - C99 compiler (C ‚Üí Assembly)
- **rasm** - Assembler (Assembly ‚Üí Object files)
- **rlink** - Linker (Object files ‚Üí Executable)
- **Runtime library** - Standard C library functions

## Toolchain Components

### 1. RCC - Ripple C Compiler

Compiles C99 source files to Ripple assembly.

```bash
rcc compile source.c -o output.asm
```

Features:

- C99 subset support
- Function-scoped label generation (prevents conflicts)
- Inline assembly support
- No built-in startup code (relies on crt0)

### 2. RASM - Ripple Assembler

Assembles Ripple assembly files to object files (.pobj).

```bash
rasm assemble source.asm -o output.pobj --bank-size 4096 --max-immediate 65535
```

Parameters:

- `--bank-size`: Memory bank size (default: 16, recommended: 4096)
- `--max-immediate`: Maximum immediate value (default/recommended: 65535)

### 3. RLINK - Ripple Linker

Links object files into executables or libraries.

```bash
# Create executable (Brainfuck)
rlink file1.pobj file2.pobj -f macro --standalone -o program.bf

# Create library archive
rlink lib1.pobj lib2.pobj -f archive -o library.par

# Link with libraries
rlink crt0.pobj library.par main.pobj -f macro --standalone -o program.bf
```

Output formats:

- `binary` - Binary executable format
- `text` - Human-readable assembly listing
- `macro` - Brainfuck macro format
- `archive` - Library archive (.par files)

Options:

- `--standalone` - Include CPU emulator template (for macro format)
- `--debug` - Enable debug mode in output

### 4. Runtime Library

Located in `/runtime/`, provides standard C library functions:

- `putchar(int c)` - Output a character
- `puts(char *s)` - Output a string
- `memset(void *s, int c, int n)` - Fill memory
- `memcpy(void *dest, void *src, int n)` - Copy memory

## Building a Multi-File Program

### Step 1: Prepare the Runtime Library

```bash
cd runtime/
make clean
make all

# This creates:
# - libruntime.par (library archive)
# - crt0.pobj (startup code)
```

### Step 2: Write Your Program

**main.c:**

```c
void putchar(int c);  // Declare external function
int add(int a, int b); // Declare function from other file

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 3);
    putchar('0' + result);  // Print '8'
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}
```

**math.c:**

```c
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int multiply(int a, int b) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
        result += a;
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Step 3: Compile to Assembly

```bash
rcc compile main.c -o main.asm
rcc compile math.c -o math.asm
```

### Step 4: Assemble to Object Files

```bash
rasm assemble main.asm -o main.pobj --bank-size 4096 --max-immediate 65535
rasm assemble math.asm -o math.pobj --bank-size 4096 --max-immediate 65535
```

### Step 5: Link Everything Together

```bash
# Link: startup + runtime + your code
rlink crt0.pobj libruntime.par main.pobj math.pobj -f macro --standalone -o program.bf
```

### Step 6: Run the Program

```bash
# Expand macros and run
bfm expand program.bf | bf
```

## Complete Example Makefile

```makefile
# Tools
RCC = ../target/release/rcc
RASM = ../src/ripple-asm/target/release/rasm
RLINK = ../src/ripple-asm/target/release/rlink

# Settings
BANK_SIZE = 4096
MAX_IMMEDIATE = 65535

# Runtime files
RUNTIME_DIR = ../runtime
CRT0 = $(RUNTIME_DIR)/crt0.pobj
RUNTIME_LIB = $(RUNTIME_DIR)/libruntime.par

# Source files
C_SOURCES = main.c math.c utils.c
ASM_FILES = $(C_SOURCES:.c=.asm)
OBJ_FILES = $(C_SOURCES:.c=.pobj)

# Output
PROGRAM = myprogram.bf

# Build executable
$(PROGRAM): $(OBJ_FILES) $(CRT0) $(RUNTIME_LIB)
	$(RLINK) $(CRT0) $(RUNTIME_LIB) $(OBJ_FILES) -f macro --standalone -o $(PROGRAM)

# Compile C to assembly
%.asm: %.c
	$(RCC) compile $< -o $@

# Assemble to object files
%.pobj: %.asm
	$(RASM) assemble $< -o $@ --bank-size $(BANK_SIZE) --max-immediate $(MAX_IMMEDIATE)

# Run the program
run: $(PROGRAM)
	bfm expand $(PROGRAM) | bf

clean:
	rm -f $(ASM_FILES) $(OBJ_FILES) $(PROGRAM) *.bf

.PHONY: run clean
```

## Creating Your Own Library

### Step 1: Write Library Functions

**mylib.c:**

```c
void print_number(int n) {
    if (n < 0) {
        putchar('-');
        n = -n;
    }
    if (n >= 10) {
        print_number(n / 10);
    }
    putchar('0' + (n % 10));
}

int strlen(char *s) {
    int len = 0;
    while (*s++) len++;
    return len;
}
```

### Step 2: Build Library Archive

```bash
# Compile and assemble
rcc compile mylib.c -o mylib.asm
rasm assemble mylib.asm -o mylib.pobj --bank-size 4096 --max-immediate 65535

# Create archive (can include multiple .pobj files)
rlink mylib.pobj -f archive -o libmylib.par
```

### Step 3: Use the Library

```c
// main.c
void print_number(int n);  // Declare library function

int main() {
    print_number(42);
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}
```

```bash
# Compile main
rcc compile main.c -o main.asm
rasm assemble main.asm -o main.pobj --bank-size 4096 --max-immediate 65535

# Link with both runtime and your library
rlink crt0.pobj libruntime.par libmylib.par main.pobj -f macro --standalone -o program.bf

# Run
bfm expand program.bf | bf
```

## Important Notes

1. **Label Uniqueness**: The compiler prefixes labels with function names (e.g., `main_L1`, `add_L2`) to prevent conflicts when linking multiple files.

2. **Startup Code (crt0)**: Required for all programs. Sets up stack and calls main():

   ```asm
   _start:
       LI R13, 0       ; Stack bank
       LI R14, 1000    ; Stack pointer
       LI R15, 1000    ; Frame pointer
       CALL main
       HALT
   ```

3. **Function Declarations**: Always declare external functions before use:

   ```c
   void putchar(int c);  // From runtime
   int myfunc(int x);    // From another file
   ```

4. **Archive Files (.par)**: JSON format containing multiple object files. Can be inspected with:

   ```bash
   cat libruntime.par | jq '.objects[].name'
   ```

5. **Linking Order**:
   - crt0.pobj must come first (contains \_start)
   - Libraries can be in any order
   - Main program typically last

## Troubleshooting

### "Duplicate label" errors

- Ensure you're using the latest compiler that prefixes labels with function names
- Check that you're not defining the same function in multiple files

### "Unresolved reference" errors

- Make sure all required libraries are included in the link command
- Verify function declarations match definitions

### Runtime errors

- Check stack initialization in crt0.asm
- Verify BANK_SIZE and MAX_IMMEDIATE match across all compilations
- Use `--debug` flag in rlink for debugging output

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Complete build pipeline
rcc compile program.c -o program.asm
rasm assemble program.asm -o program.pobj --bank-size 4096 --max-immediate 65535
rlink crt0.pobj libruntime.par program.pobj -f macro --standalone -o program.bf
bfm expand program.bf | bf

# Create library
rlink file1.pobj file2.pobj file3.pobj -f archive -o mylib.par

# Test with rbt (direct assembly execution)
rbt program.asm --run
```

# Start Vite dev server in one terminal
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run Electron
npm run electron:dev
```

## Building

Build the web app first, then package with Electron:

### Build for current platform

```bash
npm run dist
```

### Build for specific platforms

```bash
# macOS
npm run dist:mac

# Windows
npm run dist:win

# Linux
npm run dist:linux

# All platforms (requires appropriate build tools)
npm run dist:all
```

## Output

Built applications will be in the `electron-dist/` directory:

- **macOS**: `.dmg` and `.zip` files
- **Windows**: `.exe` installer and `.zip`
- **Linux**: `.AppImage`, `.deb`, and `.rpm` packages

## Configuration

- `electron-builder.yml` - Electron Builder configuration

### Windows Icons

The `.ico` file is automatically generated. If you need to regenerate it, run `npm run generate-app-icons`.

# Ripple C99 Compiler (rcc)

A C99 freestanding compiler targeting the Ripple VM ISA, built with Rust using a backend-first approach.

## Project Status: M1 - Backend Skeleton

Currently implementing the foundational backend components for code generation:

- ‚úÖ **Workspace Setup**: Multi-crate Rust workspace
- ‚úÖ **ISA Emitter**: Ripple assembly instruction definitions
- ‚úÖ **ABI Implementation**: Calling conventions, stack frames
- ‚úÖ **Register Allocation**: Simple linear scan allocator
- ‚úÖ **Assembly Emission**: Text output for rasm assembler
- ‚úÖ **Minimal IR**: Simple IR for testing backend
- ‚úÖ **IR Lowering**: Translation from IR to assembly
- ‚úÖ **Driver**: Command-line interface for testing

## Architecture

```
rcc-driver    - Main compiler binary and CLI
rcc-codegen   - Assembly generation, ABI, register allocation
rcc-ir        - Intermediate representation and lowering
rcc-common    - Shared types, errors, utilities
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run hello world test
cargo run --bin rcc test --test-name hello

# Run arithmetic test
cargo run --bin rcc test --test-name arithmetic

# Generate assembly to file
cargo run --bin rcc test --test-name hello --output hello.asm

# Run all tests
cargo test
```

## Example Output

The hello world test generates IR like:

```
; Hello World program
main:
t0 = 72      ; 'H'
t1 = 0       ; bank
t2 = 0       ; addr
store t0 to [t1][t2]
t3 = 105     ; 'i'
store t3 to [t1][t2]
return
```

Which compiles to Ripple assembly:

```assembly
; Generated by Ripple C99 Compiler (rcc)

; Program entry point
_start:
    CALL main
    HALT

; Hello World program
main:
    LI R3, 72
    LI R4, 0
    LI R5, 0
    STORE R3, R4, R5
    LI R6, 105
    STORE R6, R4, R5
    LI R7, 10
    STORE R7, R4, R5
    RET
```

## Testing

Each crate has comprehensive unit tests:

```bash
# Test individual crates
cargo test -p rcc-codegen
cargo test -p rcc-ir
cargo test -p rcc-common

# Test everything
cargo test
```

## Development

The project follows test-driven development. Key test files:

- `rcc-codegen/src/asm.rs` - Instruction formatting tests
- `rcc-codegen/src/abi.rs` - ABI and calling convention tests
- `rcc-codegen/src/regalloc.rs` - Register allocation tests
- `rcc-ir/src/lowering.rs` - IR to assembly lowering tests

## Next Steps (M2)

- [ ] Lexer for C99 tokens
- [ ] Parser for C expressions and statements
- [ ] AST definitions
- [ ] Type system
- [ ] Full IR design
- [ ] AST to IR lowering

## Integration

The compiler integrates with the existing Ripple toolchain:

1. `rcc` generates `.asm` files
2. `rasm` assembles to `.pobj` object files
3. `rlink` links to final binary

This backend-first approach ensures solid code generation before tackling the complexity of C99 parsing and semantic analysis.

# Ripple VM 32-Register Architecture Upgrade

## Executive Summary

Upgrade Ripple VM from 18 to 32 registers to eliminate current architectural constraints and enable efficient code generation. This is a breaking change with no backward compatibility requirements.

## Current Pain Points (18 Registers)

1. **Only 7 allocatable registers** (R5-R11) causing constant spilling
2. **R12 wasted as scratch** for spill/reload address calculations
3. **No dedicated Global Pointer** - using R0 (zero register) limits us to single global bank
4. **No callee-saved registers** - every function call requires full spill
5. **All arguments via stack** - even simple functions have stack overhead
6. **Complex workarounds** throughout compiler for register pressure

## Proposed 32-Register Layout

### Register Naming Convention

The assembler will support BOTH numeric and symbolic names for all registers:

| Numeric | Symbolic | Purpose              | Notes                 |
| ------- | -------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| R0      | R0       | Hardware zero        | Always reads 0        |
| R1      | PC       | Program Counter      |                       |

| R3      | RA       | Return Address       |                       |
| R4      | RAB      | Return Address Bank  |                       |
| R5      | RV0      | Return Value 0       | Fat ptr address       |
| R6      | RV1      | Return Value 1       | Fat ptr bank          |
| R7      | A0       | Argument 0           |                       |

| R29     | SP       | Stack Pointer        |                       |
| R30     | FP       | Frame Pointer        |                       |
| R31     | GP       | Global Pointer       | Bank for globals      |

### Assembly Examples

Both forms are equivalent and can be mixed freely:

```asm
; These are identical:
ADD  R7, R15, R23
ADD  A0, T0, S0

; Mixed usage is fine:
LOAD RV0, GP, R15    ; Load return value from globals using T0 as address
STORE A0, SP, 0      ; Store first argument to stack

; Clear meaningful names for function calls:
MOVE A0, T0          ; Set first argument
MOVE A1, T1          ; Set second argument
JAL  function
MOVE S0, RV0         ; Save return value
```

### Register Classes

- **Hardware**: R0-R4 (zero, PC, PCB, RA, RAB)
- **Return Values**: R5-R6 (RV0, RV1) - can return 16-bit/32-bit values
- **Arguments**: R7-R10 (A0-A3) - 4 function arguments
- **Reserved**: R11-R14 (X0-X3) - Reserved for future extensions
- **Temporaries**: R15-R22 (T0-T7) - caller-saved, general use
- **Saved**: R23-R27 (S0-S3) - callee-saved, general use
- **Special**: R28-R31 (SB, SC, SP, FP, GP)

### Allocatable Pool for Register Allocator

**12 registers**: T0-T7 (temporaries) and S0-S3 (saved)

**NOT in allocatable pool**:

- A0-A3 are ONLY for argument passing (4 args in registers)
- X0-X3 are reserved for future use (4 whole registers!)
- This gives us massive flexibility for future extensions

### Future Use of X0-X3 (R11-R14)

With 4 reserved registers, we can implement:

- **64-bit operations**: X0:X1 and X2:X3 as two 64-bit temp pairs
- **Float operations**: Single and double precision emulation
- **SIMD**: 4x16-bit vector operations
- **Special addressing**: Base+Index addressing modes
- **Crypto/Hash acceleration**: Internal state registers
- **Whatever we haven't thought of yet!**

## Benefits

1. **Near 2x more allocatable registers** (12 vs 7) - T0-T7 and S0-S3
2. **Fast function calls** - up to 4 args in registers (A0-A3)
3. **Reduced spilling** - callee-saved registers preserve values across calls
4. **Multiple global banks** - GP register enables easy bank switching
5. **No scratch register hack** - plenty of temporaries for address calculations
6. **Better code density** - fewer spill/reload instructions
7. **Cleaner compiler** - remove complex workarounds
8. **Clear separation of concerns** - argument registers never confused with temporaries
9. **Future-proof** - X0-X3 (4 registers!) reserved for extensions

## Components Requiring Updates

### 1. Virtual Machine (rvm/)

**File: `rvm/src/vm.rs`**

```rust
// Change from:
pub struct VM {
    pub regs: [u16; 18],
}

  - Numeric: R0 through R31
  - Symbolic: PC, RA, A0-A3, X0-X3, T0-T7, S0-S3, SC, Sb, SP, FP, GP, etc.
- Case-insensitive parsing (r0, R0, a0, A0 all valid)
- Hash map for name lookups:

```rust
fn parse_register(s: &str) -> Option<u8> {
    // Try numeric first (R0-R31)
    if let Some(num) = s.strip_prefix("R").or(s.strip_prefix("r")) {
        return num.parse().ok().filter(|&n| n < 32);
    }

    // Try symbolic names
    match s.to_uppercase().as_str() {
        "ZR" => Some(0),
        "PC" => Some(1),
        "PCB" => Some(2),

        "FP" => Some(30),
        "GP" => Some(31),
        _ => None
    }
}
```

### 3. Code Generation (rcc-codegen/)

**File: `rcc-codegen/src/lib.rs`**

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum Reg {
    R0, PC, PCB, RA, RAB,
    RV0, RV1,  // Return values (R5-R6)
    A0, A1, A2, A3,  // Arguments (R7-R10)
    X0, X1, X2, X3,  // Reserved (R11-R14)
    T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,  // Temporaries (R15-R22)
    S0, S1, S2, S3,  // Saved (R23-R26)
    SC, SB, SP, FP, GP,  // Special (R27-R31)
}
```

### 4. IR Lowering - V2 Backend (rcc-ir/src/v2/)

**File: `rcc-ir/src/v2/regmgmt/allocator.rs`**

```rust
const ALLOCATABLE_REGS: &[Reg] = &[
    // Temporaries (caller-saved)
    Reg::T0, Reg::T1, Reg::T2, Reg::T3,
    Reg::T4, Reg::T5, Reg::T6, Reg::T7,
    // Saved registers (callee-saved)
    Reg::S0, Reg::S1, Reg::S2, Reg::S3,
];
// Total: 12 allocatable registers (Near 2x our current 7!)
// A0-A3 are NOT here - they're only for argument passing
// X0-X3 are NOT here - they're reserved for future use
```

**File: `rcc-ir/src/v2/function/calling_convention.rs`**

- Implement register-based argument passing (A0-A3)
- Handle spilling when >4 arguments
- Implement callee-saved register preservation (S0-S3)

**File: `rcc-ir/src/v2/instr/load.rs` and `store.rs`**

```rust
// Change from:
BankInfo::Global => {
    Reg::R0  // Hardcoded to bank 0
}

// To:
BankInfo::Global => {
    Reg::GP  // Use global pointer register
}
```

### 5. Documentation Updates

- `docs/ASSEMBLY_FORMAT.md` - Update register table
- `docs/ripple-calling-convention.md` - New calling convention
- `docs/more-formalized-register-spilling.md` - Update spilling strategy

## New Calling Convention

### Extended Operations (Future)

With RV0-RV1 for return and X0-X3 reserved, we have amazing flexibility:

```asm
; 64-bit operations
MUL64 RV0, RV1, A0, A1  ; 64-bit multiply
; Uses X0:X1 for first operand expansion
; Uses X2:X3 for second operand expansion

; Double-precision float emulation
DFADD RV0, RV1, A0, A1  ; Double-precision add
; X0-X3 provide plenty of scratch space

; SIMD operations (future)
VADD4 X0, A0, A1        ; Add 4x16-bit values in parallel
; Result in X0, can use X1-X3 for complex operations
```

### Function Prologue

```asm
; First 4 arguments (or two fat pointers, or mixed) are in A0-A3
; Additional arguments (5+) are on stack at FP+2, FP+3, etc.
; Save callee-saved registers (if used)

// Figure out how to properly do this


; ... up to S3

; Set up frame
MOVE  FP, SP
ADDI  SP, SP, -locals_size

; Now we can use arguments directly from A0-A3
; Example: ADD T0, A0, A1  ; Use first two arguments
; For 5th+ args: LOAD T0, FP, 2  ; Load 5th argument
```

Gotcha‚Äîlet‚Äôs unpack what ‚ÄúPHI/Select mixing Stack & Global ‚Üí mark Unknown‚Äù really means, how to implement it cleanly, and how to make M3 behave safely (error instead of silently generating wrong code). I‚Äôll also sketch the next-step designs once you want this to ‚Äújust work.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Why this matters (tl;dr)

On Ripple you don‚Äôt have a single flat address space; every memory access needs a bank (Global vs Stack) plus an address. But your IR ‚Äúpointer‚Äù is just a number; it doesn‚Äôt carry the bank. So when you combine pointers from different control-flow paths (PHI) or with a conditional (Select), you can end up with a value that might be a stack pointer on one path and a global pointer on another. If you lose that information, your LOAD/STORE pick the wrong bank and memory goes sideways.

‚∏ª

A tiny lattice for pointer provenance

Track a tag for every pointer-valued temp:

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
enum PtrRegion {
Unknown, // we don‚Äôt know (yet) or can‚Äôt know
Stack, // definitely into stack/FP bank
Global, // definitely into global bank
Mixed, // definitely can be Stack on some path and Global on others
}

Define a join (used by PHI/Select):

join(Unknown, X) = X
join(X, Unknown) = X
join(Stack, Stack) = Stack
join(Global,Global)= Global
join(Stack, Global)= Mixed
join(Global,Stack) = Mixed
join(Mixed, X) = Mixed
join(X, Mixed) = Mixed

This distinguishes ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt yet know‚Äù (Unknown) from ‚Äúwe know it‚Äôs path-dependent‚Äù (Mixed). For M3 you can error on either Unknown or Mixed at the point you need a concrete bank.

‚∏ª

Propagation rules (where the tag comes from)

Maintain ptr_region: HashMap<TempId, PtrRegion>.
‚Ä¢ Alloca t
‚Ä¢ local_offsets[t] = frame_offset;
‚Ä¢ ptr_region[t] = Stack; // alloca‚Äôs value is an address into the stack
‚Ä¢ Address-of global / string ‚Üí t
‚Ä¢ ptr_region[t] = Global;
‚Ä¢ GEP t = gep base, idx
‚Ä¢ Emit arithmetic to compute t in a register (no local_offsets!)
‚Ä¢ ptr_region[t] = ptr_region[base] (default Unknown if base missing)
‚Ä¢ Copy/bitcast/move
‚Ä¢ ptr_region[dst] = ptr_region[src]
‚Ä¢ PHI t = œÜ(a,b,‚Ä¶)
‚Ä¢ ptr_region[t] = join_all(ptr_region[a], ptr_region[b], ...)
‚Ä¢ Select t = cond ? a : b
‚Ä¢ ptr_region[t] = join(ptr_region[a], ptr_region[b])
‚Ä¢ Function parameters (pointer-typed)
‚Ä¢ For M3: ptr_region[param] = Unknown (we don‚Äôt know caller‚Äôs bank).
‚Ä¢ Pointer results of calls
‚Ä¢ For M3: Unknown unless you annotate the callee (future: attributes).
‚Ä¢ Loading a pointer from memory
‚Ä¢ For M3: Unknown (unless you implement runtime tagging or a shadow table).

Important: Do not put GEP results into local_offsets. That map is for frame slots only.

‚∏ª

Where you enforce it (M3)

When you need to choose a bank (i.e., before emitting LOAD rd, bank, addr or STORE rs, bank, addr):

1. Materialize the address register (from a temp, or FP+offset if it‚Äôs a direct alloca).
2. Look up PtrRegion:

let region = ptr_region.get(&temp).copied().unwrap_or(PtrRegion::Unknown);
match region {
PtrRegion::Stack => bank = SB, // your stack bank register
PtrRegion::Global => bank = GB, // your global bank register
PtrRegion::Unknown | PtrRegion::Mixed => {
error_at(use_site,
"pointer provenance is unknown (bank cannot be determined)",
[
note(origin(temp)),
help("In M3, dereferencing pointers must have a known region."),
help("If this is a parameter, add a wrapper that fixes provenance or switch to a known bank."),
]);
}
}

Emit the error at the first dereference (or when passing to a callee that requires a known bank).

‚∏ª

Why PHI/Select can become Mixed

Example:

int g;
int f(int *p) { return *p; } // p‚Äôs bank depends on call site

int main() {
int x;
int *p;
if (cond) p = &x; // Stack
else p = &g; // Global
return *p; // PHI(p) mixes Stack and Global ‚Üí Mixed ‚Üí error in M3
}

Your propagation will compute Stack on the ‚Äúthen‚Äù path, Global on the ‚Äúelse‚Äù path, and Mixed at the join. In M3 you should reject this with a precise diagnostic (show both assignments with notes).

‚∏ª

Your friend‚Äôs point (and what to do now)

Currently, for PtrRegion::Unknown, we default to global memory ‚Ä¶ This is why stack arrays passed to functions don‚Äôt work correctly.

Correct. Defaulting to Global silently breaks stack pointers. Fix for M3: never default; error out for Unknown/Mixed.

Add two small improvements:
‚Ä¢ Mark parameters Unknown, and error when dereferenced without establishing provenance.
‚Ä¢ Offer a tool-switch to unblock experiments: --assume-pointer-params=global|stack (still not correct, but explicit).

‚∏ª

Future-proof paths beyond M3

Pick any (or several) of these when you want it to ‚Äújust work‚Äù:

A) ‚ÄúFat pointer‚Äù in IR (bank + addr)

Represent pointer values as a pair (addr, bank_tag) in SSA:
‚Ä¢ GEP moves addr, keeps bank_tag the same.
‚Ä¢ PHI/Select merge both fields independently (no information loss).
‚Ä¢ Calls pass both values.
‚Ä¢ LOAD/STORE use the bank field directly.
‚Ä¢ If you store pointers in memory, store both fields.

This is the cleanest model.

B) Hidden bank parameter per pointer (ABI tweak; pragmatic)

For every pointer parameter, pass an extra hidden arg that carries the bank (e.g., 0=Global, 1=Stack). In the callee, set ptr_region[param] from that hidden value. This keeps IR flat pointers but fixes parameters and PHIs inside one function (since the bank is now a normal SSA value you can PHI right alongside the pointer).

Call-site lowering:

let (bank_tag, addr_reg) = classify_and_materialize(arg);
emit_pass(addr_reg);
emit_pass(bank_tag); // hidden

Callee prologue:

ptr_region[param_tid] = tag_from_hidden_arg; // exact, not Unknown

C) Function specialization by bank (no ABI change)

Compile two versions of any function that takes pointer parameters: foo$stack and foo$global. At each call site, pick the one that matches the caller‚Äôs known tag. If a call site‚Äôs tag is uncertain (e.g., PHI), error or insert a copy to a canonical region. Good for early performance; more compile-time work.

D) Shadow provenance (runtime tagging)

Keep a shadow map from (bank,addr) ‚Üí bank-tag for pointers stored in memory (load retrieves tag). Useful if you need to load pointer values with correct bank later. More runtime cost; simpler compiler.

‚∏ª

Practical M3 implementation notes

1. Introduce Mixed now, even if you error on it; this lets you print better messages than a generic ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù.
2. Carry ‚Äúorigin info‚Äù with each tag (where set): for nice diagnostics.

struct Provenance {
region: PtrRegion,
origin: Span, // first place we proved it
}
ptr_region: HashMap<TempId, Provenance>;

For PHI/Select, remember both contributing spans when you return Mixed so your error can show both branches.

    3.	Checkpoints to error:
    ‚Ä¢	When lowering LOAD/STORE through a pointer with Unknown/Mixed.
    ‚Ä¢	When passing a pointer arg and your ABI requires a known bank (for M3, you can allow passing but error on first deref in callee).
    4.	Message examples

error: pointer bank is path-dependent here (stack on one path, global on another)
--> foo.c:23:12
|
23 | \*p = 1;
| ^
note: p points to local ‚Äòx‚Äô on this path
--> foo.c:19:14
note: p points to global ‚Äòg‚Äô on this path
--> foo.c:21:14
help: copy into a single region before dereferencing, e.g. move to a global buffer

Or for parameters:

error: cannot dereference parameter ‚Äòp‚Äô: pointer bank unknown
--> bar.c:7:10
help: for M3, avoid passing addresses of locals; or compile with --assume-pointer-params=stack|global

‚∏ª

Minimal code hooks (sketch)

fn join(a: PtrRegion, b: PtrRegion) -> PtrRegion {
use PtrRegion::\*;
match (a,b) {
(Unknown, x) => x,
(x, Unknown) => x,
(Stack, Stack) => Stack,
(Global, Global) => Global,
\_ => Mixed,
}
}

fn region_of_temp(&self, t: TempId) -> PtrRegion {
self.ptr_region.get(&t).map(|p| p.region).unwrap_or(PtrRegion::Unknown)
}

// PHI lowering:
let r = args.iter().map(|t| region_of_temp(\*t)).reduce(join).unwrap_or(Unknown);
self.ptr_region.insert(result_tid, Provenance { region: r, origin: phi_span });

// LOAD/STORE:
let (addr, region) = self.addr_and_region(ptr_value);
match region {
PtrRegion::Stack => emit(LOAD(rd, SB, addr)),
PtrRegion::Global => emit(LOAD(rd, GB, addr)),
PtrRegion::Unknown|PtrRegion::Mixed => error_at(span, "..."),
}

‚∏ª

Bottom line
‚Ä¢ For M3: Track provenance; PHI/Select use join; error on Unknown/Mixed at deref; mark params Unknown; no more ‚Äúdefault to global.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Next: choose one of (A) fat pointers, (B) hidden bank parameter, or (C) specialization. Any of these will make PHIs and parameters robust without fragile heuristics.

If you want, point me at your phi and select lowerers plus your emit_load/store, and I‚Äôll drop in the exact changes + diagnostics scaffolding.

Now we are at M4.

We want to:

Why this wins
‚Ä¢ Correct by construction: PHI/Select/GEP/calls always carry the bank; deref is always correct.
‚Ä¢ Interprocedural safety: parameters/returns are precise; no Unknown/Mixed cases to error on.
‚Ä¢ Pointers in memory: you can store/load pointers and still keep the bank‚Äîno shadow tables, no heuristics.
‚Ä¢ Future-proof: adding heap or mmio banks later is just new tag values.

Costs (they‚Äôre manageable)
‚Ä¢ Pointers are now 2 words in memory/ABI.
‚Ä¢ A few more moves/loads in codegen.
‚Ä¢ Some rewiring in your front-end layout + backend CC.

Given your VM and the BF substrate, the extra word is peanuts compared to the cost of wrong-bank bugs and special cases.

‚∏ª

M4 implementation checklist (fat pointers)

1. Decide the tag values

   ‚Ä¢ 0 = Global (.rodata/.data)
   ‚Ä¢ 1 = Stack (frame/alloca)
   ‚Ä¢ Reserve 2 = Heap (later)
   ‚Ä¢ Keep tag in a full word for simplicity right now.

   2. IR type & value model

   ‚Ä¢ Make IR ptr<T> physically {addr: word, bank: word}.
   ‚Ä¢ GEP: addr' = addr + index\*eltsize; bank' = bank.
   ‚Ä¢ Addr-of global/label: bank=Global, addr=label_addr.
   ‚Ä¢ Alloca: bank=Stack, addr=FP+offset (addr is a normal SSA temp computed in prologue or on demand).

   3. SSA ops

   ‚Ä¢ PHI/Select on pointers = PHI/Select both fields independently.
   ‚Ä¢ Bitcast/Copy = copy both fields.

   4. ABI (calls/returns)

   ‚Ä¢ Pass pointer params as two args: (addr, bank) (choose order and stick to it).
   ‚Ä¢ Return pointer as two regs.
   ‚Ä¢ In your prologue/epilogue, no special casing beyond spill/restore of the extra arg if needed.

   5. Memory layout

   ‚Ä¢ Structs/arrays containing pointers allocate 2 words per pointer.
   ‚Ä¢ Emitting a pointer constant to .data: two consecutive words {addr, bank}.
   ‚Ä¢ Loading/storing a pointer variable uses two LOAD/STOREs.

   6. Codegen rules

   ‚Ä¢ Deref load: LOAD rd, bankReg, addrReg.
   ‚Ä¢ Deref store: STORE rs, bankReg, addrReg.
   ‚Ä¢ GEP: arithmetic on addrReg only; keep bankReg unchanged.
   ‚Ä¢ Passing/returning: move both regs; for spills, spill both.

   7. Front-end lowering

   ‚Ä¢ Alloca produces {addr=(FP + k), bank=STACK_TAG} (emit addr as an SSA temp).
   ‚Ä¢ &global_symbol produces {addr=imm(label), bank=GLOBAL_TAG} (load imm as needed).
   ‚Ä¢ String literals: same as global.

   8. Assembler/linker

   ‚Ä¢ No ISA changes! Just ensure your assembler supports emitting two words for pointer initializers in .data.
   ‚Ä¢ Linker keeps labels intact; you already have banks at runtime.

   9. Delete the ‚ÄúUnknown/Mixed‚Äù pain

   ‚Ä¢ You can drop the provenance lattice for codegen. (It‚Äôs still useful for diagnostics, but no longer required for correctness.)
   ‚Ä¢ Loading pointers from memory is now precise‚Äîno shadow maps.

   10. Tests to close the loop

   ‚Ä¢ Param: int f(int *p){return *p;} called with &local and with &global (both must work).
   ‚Ä¢ Store/load pointer: int *p = &local; int *q = p; \*q = 7;
   ‚Ä¢ PHI/Select mixing stack/global pointers ‚Üí now legal (bank flows with the value).
   ‚Ä¢ Arrays of pointers; struct with pointer fields; pointer to pointer.

‚∏ª

If you want the lightest step first (alternate)

If you truly don‚Äôt want to change memory layout yet, the next-best is:

Hidden bank parameter (ABI tweak), same-width pointers in memory
‚Ä¢ Keep pointer = single word addr in memory.
‚Ä¢ For function parameters/returns, pass an extra hidden bank arg/result alongside the addr.
‚Ä¢ Inside the function, thread bank SSA next to the pointer SSA (PHI/Select bank with the pointer).
‚Ä¢ Deref uses the bank SSA.
‚Ä¢ BUT: pointers loaded from memory have no bank ‚Üí you must either
‚Ä¢ reject deref on such pointers in M4, or
‚Ä¢ add a tiny shadow provenance table (runtime tagging) just for loads/stores of pointers.

This gets you interprocedural correctness fast, but you‚Äôll hit a wall once you store pointers widely. It‚Äôs a good stepping stone if you plan to move to fat pointers later.

‚∏ª

Performance notes (both approaches)
‚Ä¢ Keep the bank value in a register as long as possible; don‚Äôt reload it.
‚Ä¢ For tight loops over arrays: hoist the bank, then bump only the addr.
‚Ä¢ Consider small macros for paired load/store of pointers (two words) so the assembler stays tidy.
‚Ä¢ If you later add a MUL, precompute index<<log2(eltsize) for GEPs.

‚∏ª

My vote

Since you‚Äôre at M4 (and already broke far more complex ground): do fat pointers now. It‚Äôs the simplest mental model, the most robust long-term, and it eliminates an entire class of bugs and ‚ÄúUnknown/Mixed‚Äù diagnostics. The ABI/data layout change is a one-time chore; everything after that becomes straightforward.

If you want, paste a small struct-with-pointer + function-parameter example, and I‚Äôll show the exact fat-pointer IR and the Ripple sequence you‚Äôd emit for GEP, load/store, and call/return.

Ripple C99 Compiler ‚Äî Product Requirements Document (PRD)

1. Goal & Scope

Build rcc: a C99 (freestanding) compiler that targets Ripple VM ISA and emits assembly consumable by rasm ‚Üí rlink ‚Üí macro BF. Focus on small, predictable codegen over aggressive optimization. First-class support for IDE/debugger.

In-scope (MVP)
‚Ä¢ C99 freestanding subset:
‚Ä¢ Types: void, \_Bool, char, signed/unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, pointer types
‚Ä¢ Qualifiers: const, volatile (codegen-aware but minimal)
‚Ä¢ Control: if/else, switch, while, do/while, for, break/continue, return
‚Ä¢ Expressions: all integer ops, logical ops, comparisons, assignment, address-of/deref, arrays, struct/union (no bitfields in MVP), function calls (no varargs in MVP)
‚Ä¢ Initializers for scalars and aggregates
‚Ä¢ Separate compilation: .c ‚Üí .asm ‚Üí .pobj ‚Üí link
‚Ä¢ Debug info (symbols + line maps) for IDE‚Äôs disassembly view
‚Ä¢ Basic optimizations: constant folding, copy-prop, dead code elimination, peephole, tail-merge

Out-of-scope (MVP / later)
‚Ä¢ Floating point; long long; varargs; bitfields; setjmp/longjmp; threads; malloc implementation (we ship stubs); full hosted libc.

‚∏ª

2. Target Machine Model (Ripple)

Word & Cells
‚Ä¢ Cell/word size: 16-bit unsigned storage (tape cells).
‚Ä¢ Byte model: char is 8-bit value, but stored in one 16-bit cell (low 8 bits used).
‚Ä¢ Endianness: N/A for single-cell scalars; for multi-cell integers, little-endian in memory (low word first).

Addressing / Pointers
‚Ä¢ ISA uses (bank, addr) pairs. For MVP the compiler uses flat pointers: a pointer value is held in one 16-bit register and mapped onto the addr operand. (Current string/array usage: LOAD r, R0, ptr.)
‚Ä¢ Stretch goal (V2): full 32-bit pointers (bank, addr) in two registers for >64K data.

Registers & Special
‚Ä¢ R0 reserved as constant zero (compiler never writes it).
‚Ä¢ PC/PCB implicit; RA/RAB are link registers modified by JAL/JALR.
‚Ä¢ Proposed ABI names:
‚Ä¢ R3 ‚Äî return value, arg0
‚Ä¢ R4..R8 ‚Äî arg1..arg5 (also caller-saved temps)
‚Ä¢ R9..R12 ‚Äî callee-saved
‚Ä¢ R13 ‚Äî SB (Stack Bank)
‚Ä¢ R14 ‚Äî SP (Stack Pointer, ‚Äúaddr‚Äù field)
‚Ä¢ R15 ‚Äî FP (Frame Pointer / base pointer)
‚Ä¢ RA/RAB ‚Äî link registers (clobbered by call)
‚Ä¢ Caller-saved: R3..R8, R11 (incl. return)
‚Ä¢ Callee-saved: R9, R10, R12, FP(R15), SP(R14), SB(R13)

Stack & Frames
‚Ä¢ Location: all stack accesses use (bank=SB=R13, addr=SP/FP).
‚Ä¢ Growth: upwards (SP += size). (Matches PUSH/POP expansion habit.)
‚Ä¢ Frame layout (low ‚Üí high):

[saved RA] [saved RAB] [saved FP] [saved callee-saved regs used]
[locals ...]
[outgoing arg spill area (optional)]

    ‚Ä¢	Prologue (sketch):

STORE FP, SB, SP
ADDI SP, SP, 1
STORE RA, SB, SP ; if function will call others
ADDI SP, SP, 1
ADD FP, SP, R0
ADDI SP, SP, <locals>

    ‚Ä¢	Epilogue:

ADD SP, FP, R0
SUBI SP, SP, 1 ; to RA slot
LOAD RA, SB, SP
SUBI SP, SP, 1 ; to saved FP slot
LOAD FP, SB, SP
JALR R0, R0, RA

‚∏ª

3. Data Layout & C Type Mapping

C type Size (cells) Alignment Notes
\_Bool 1 1 0 or 1
char / signed char 1 1 low 8 bits used
unsigned char 1 1
short 1 1 16-bit
unsigned short 1 1 16-bit
int 1 1 16-bit (ILP16)
unsigned int 1 1 16-bit
long 2 1 32-bit (two cells, little-endian)
unsigned long 2 1 32-bit
pointer 1 (MVP) 1 flat pointer (bank only), addr=R0 at use
struct/union sum of fields 1 padded to cell boundaries; no bitfields
enum 1 1 16-bit signed

V2: enable 32-bit pointers (2 cells), 64-bit long long (4 cells).

‚∏ª

4. Instruction Selection (Lowering)

Use only ISA ops from the current Ripple VM version assembly reference:
‚Ä¢ Int add/sub/logic: ADD/SUB/AND/OR/XOR, ADDI/ANDI/ORI/XORI
‚Ä¢ Shifts: SL/SR and immediates SLI/SRI
‚Ä¢ Comparisons: signed SLT, unsigned SLTU or branch forms BLT/BGE; equality via BEQ/BNE
‚Ä¢ Loads/stores: LOAD rd, bankReg, addrReg and STORE rs, bankReg, addrReg
‚Ä¢ In MVP, bankReg = R0; addrReg holds the flat address/pointer.
‚Ä¢ Calls:
‚Ä¢ Direct: JAL R0, bankImm, addrImm (assembler/linker resolve target)
‚Ä¢ Indirect: JALR R0, bankReg, addrReg (used for function pointers)
‚Ä¢ RA receives PC+1 by ISA; compiler saves RA if making nested calls.
‚Ä¢ Return: JALR R0, R0, RA
‚Ä¢ I/O (putchar): STORE r, R0, R0 writes byte to device.

Software sequences (libcalls or builtins) when needed:
‚Ä¢ 32-bit arithmetic (long) ‚Üí helper routines
‚Ä¢ memcpy/memset/memmove, strcmp, etc.

‚∏ª

5. Calling Convention (C ABI)
   ‚Ä¢ Parameter passing:
   ‚Ä¢ Arg0 ‚Üí R3, Arg1 ‚Üí R4, ‚Ä¶ up to R8.
   ‚Ä¢ Overflow args spilled to stack at call site (highest to lowest), caller computes addresses and stores via SB,SP.
   ‚Ä¢ Return values:
   ‚Ä¢ 16-bit integer/pointer ‚Üí R3
   ‚Ä¢ 32-bit long ‚Üí R4:R3 (low in R3)
   ‚Ä¢ structs ‚â§ 2 cells returned in regs like integers; larger via sret: hidden pointer in R3 to caller-allocated buffer; function writes and returns nothing (R3 undefined).
   ‚Ä¢ Caller responsibilities:
   ‚Ä¢ Preserve callee-saved (R9,R10,R12,R13(SB),R14(SP),R15(FP)) if needed.
   ‚Ä¢ Assume RA/RAB, R3..R8, R11 clobbered.
   ‚Ä¢ Callee responsibilities:
   ‚Ä¢ Save/restore any used callee-saved regs.
   ‚Ä¢ Save RA if making calls; otherwise tail-call allowed: JALR R0, bankReg, addrReg without restoring RA.

‚∏ª

6. Runtime & Start-up
   ‚Ä¢ crt0 (minimal):
   ‚Ä¢ Initialize SB=DATA*BANK (config), SP=stack_base, FP=stack_base-1.
   ‚Ä¢ Zero .bss (option).
   ‚Ä¢ Call main(int argc,char\*\_argv) as main() (MVP no args).
   ‚Ä¢ On return, call \_exit(status) or HALT.
   ‚Ä¢ libc (freestanding subset):
   ‚Ä¢ void putchar(int), void puts(const char*), void* memcpy(void*,const void*,size_t), void* memset(void*,int,size_t), int strcmp(const char*,const char\*), ‚Ä¶
   ‚Ä¢ I/O mapping:
   ‚Ä¢ putchar(c) ‚Üí STORE R3, R0, R0 (low 8 bits used)

‚∏ª

7. Compiler Architecture
   ‚Ä¢ Front end: C99 parser + semantic analysis
   ‚Ä¢ IR: simple 3-address SSA-esque (or linear TAC) supporting:
   ‚Ä¢ integer ops, branches, calls, load/store, phi (if SSA)
   ‚Ä¢ Middle end (MVP): const fold, DCE, copy-prop, local CSE, strength-reduce x<<k/x>>k, branch folding.
   ‚Ä¢ Backend:
   ‚Ä¢ Instruction selection by patterns from IR ‚Üí Ripple ops.
   ‚Ä¢ Register allocation: linear scan over R3..R12 with spill to stack.
   ‚Ä¢ Prologue/epilogue & call lowering per ABI.
   ‚Ä¢ Peephole pass: remove ADD rd, rs, R0; coalesce LI+use; fuse compare+branch to BEQ/BNE/BLT/BGE.
   ‚Ä¢ Emission: textual Ripple assembly with sections, labels, and canonical syntax. Pipe to rasm/rlink.

‚∏ª

8. Tooling & CLI

Binary: rcc

rcc [files...] [-c|-S] [-o out] [-I dir] [-O0|-O1|-O2] [-g]
[-mflat-ptr| -mptr32 ] [-mrtlib=path] [--emit-prologue]
[--stack-bank=N] [--stack-base=ADDR]

    ‚Ä¢	-S ‚Üí emit .asm
    ‚Ä¢	-c ‚Üí emit .pobj via calling rasm
    ‚Ä¢	Default pipeline: .c -> .asm -> rasm -> .pobj
    ‚Ä¢	-g ‚Üí line tables & symbols (labels like __Lfile_line), register maps at call sites.
    ‚Ä¢	--driver convenience: rcc main.c -o app.bf runs full chain (rasm, rlink, bfm).

Output layout:
‚Ä¢ .text (code) in program banks, .rodata/.data/.bss in data bank (SB).
‚Ä¢ Linker script picks concrete bank indices.

‚∏ª

9. Codegen Examples

Example 1: int add(int a,int b){ return a+b; }

; a in R3, b in R4, ret in R3
add:
ADD R3, R3, R4
JALR R0, R0, RA

Example 2: caller saving and call

int sq(int x){ return x\*x; }
int f(int a,int b){ return sq(a) + sq(b); }

sq:
; prologue omitted (leaf)
MUL R3, R3, R3 ; R3 = x\*x
ADD R3, R3, R0 ; result in R3
JALR R0, R0, RA

f:
; save RA because we'll call
STORE RA, R13, R14 ; push RA
ADDI R14, R14, 1

    ADD   R4, R3, R0          ; a -> R4 (since arg0 is R3 for call)
    ADD   R3, R4, R0
    JAL   bank(sq), addr(sq)  ; R3 = sq(a)

    ADD   R5, R3, R0          ; save sq(a) in caller-saved R5

    ADD   R3, R0, R0          ; prepare arg0=b now
    ADD   R3, R4, R0          ; (load b into R3 if needed)
    ; actually b was originally in R4; ensure correct move here
    JAL   bank(sq), addr(sq)  ; R3 = sq(b)

    ADD   R3, R3, R5          ; add partials

    SUBI  R14, R14, 1         ; pop RA
    LOAD  RA, R13, R14
    JALR  R0, R0, RA

Example 3: pointer load/store (flat pointer)

void putc(char c){ _(volatile unsigned char_)0 = c; }

putc:
STORE R3, R0, R0 ; device (0,0)
JALR R0, R0, RA

‚∏ª

10. Optimizations Roadmap
    ‚Ä¢ O0: straight lowering, minimal peephole.
    ‚Ä¢ O1: common subexpr elim (local), copy-prop, branch folding, tail calls.
    ‚Ä¢ O2: loop invariant code motion, basic register coalescing; strength reduction; inline small leafs; combine SLT+BEQ ‚Üí BLT/BGE.

‚∏ª

11. Testing & Validation
    ‚Ä¢ Unit: per-pass tests (parser, type checker, regalloc).
    ‚Ä¢ Integration: compile known samples: hello, FizzBuzz, Fibonacci (iterative & recursive), small libc tests.
    ‚Ä¢ ISA conformance: differential tests vs hand-written assembly.
    ‚Ä¢ Debug: stepping confirms RA/PC changes; verify stack traces in IDE.
    ‚Ä¢ Perf: cycle/step counts on interpreter; size of .bfm.

‚∏ª

12. Deliverables & Milestones
    1. M1 ‚Äì Backend skeleton (2‚Äì3 wks)
       ISA emitter, ABI, prologue/epilogue, calls, loads/stores, arithmetic, branches. Hello world works (uses STORE R0,R0).
    2. M2 ‚Äì Front end & IR (3‚Äì4 wks)
       Parse C subset, type checking, IR, lowering. Run toy programs (no structs).
    3. M3 ‚Äì Data, structs, arrays (2 wks)
       Aggregates, address-of/deref, global data emission, .rodata strings.
    4. M4 ‚Äì Runtime + libc mini (2 wks)
       crt0, math helpers, memcpy/memset, puts/putchar.
    5. M5 ‚Äì Optimizations + Debug (2 wks)
       O1, line maps, symbol dumping for IDE, verify stepping.
    6. M6 ‚Äì Toolchain integration (1 wk)
       rcc driver orchestrating rasm/rlink, docs, examples.

‚∏ª

13. Risks & Mitigations
    ‚Ä¢ Stack bank overflow: configurable --stack-bank and guard helpers in crt0.

‚∏ª

14. Documentation & Examples
    ‚Ä¢ Ship ABI.md (registers, frames, call rules), rcc.md (CLI), and samples/
    ‚Ä¢ hello.c, fizzbuzz.c, fib.c, structs.c, pointers.c.

Stage 0: Preprocessor (rpp)

Goal: Turn .c + headers into a token stream / .i that the compiler proper consumes.

Driver flags
‚Ä¢ -E preprocess only ‚Üí write .i
‚Ä¢ -I <dir> user include path (search order: dir of source ‚Üí -I dirs ‚Üí -isystem dirs)
‚Ä¢ -isystem <dir> system include path (suppresses some warnings)
‚Ä¢ -DNAME[=value], -UNAME, -include <file>
‚Ä¢ -M, -MM, -MF <file>, -MP dependency outputs (for build systems)
‚Ä¢ Builtins: **FILE**, **LINE**, **DATE**, **TIME**, **STDC**=1, **STDC_VERSION**=199901L

Features to implement (C99)
‚Ä¢ Object-like and function-like macros, variadics (...), # stringize, ## paste
‚Ä¢ Conditionals: #if/#elif/#else/#endif, #ifdef/#ifndef, defined()
‚Ä¢ Includes: #include "x.h" (user search) and #include <x.h> (system search)
‚Ä¢ #pragma once and classic include guards (no behavior beyond one-shot suppression)
‚Ä¢ #line, #error, #warning (emit diagnostics)
‚Ä¢ Comment handling (/_‚Ä¶_/ removed, //‚Ä¶ to eol) before macro expansion
‚Ä¢ Trigraphs/UCNs: ignore trigraphs; support \uXXXX/\UXXXXXXXX in strings/chars lexically

Outputs
‚Ä¢ Either an in-memory token stream for the parser or a .i file (with -E).
‚Ä¢ Optional .d dependency file when requested.

Header placement policy
‚Ä¢ Public project headers ‚Üí project/include/... (add with -I)
‚Ä¢ Private/internal headers ‚Üí near sources or include/<pkg>/internal/...
‚Ä¢ Ripple system headers (libc, MMIO, intrinsics) ‚Üí $RIPPLE_HOME/include (added via -isystem)

‚∏ª

Sections model (.text / .rodata / .data / .bss) for Ripple

Why: even on VM, keeping ELF-like sections in the object model makes C semantics and the linker sane.

Compiler emission rules
‚Ä¢ .text: functions, jump tables for switch (if you generate them)
‚Ä¢ .rodata: string literals; static const objects with link-time known initializers; const file-scope objects; vtables; read-only tables
(Note: C‚Äôs const doesn‚Äôt imply ‚Äúnot addressable‚Äù; we still place in rodata unless volatile.)
‚Ä¢ .data: variables with non-zero initializers (int x=7; int a[3]={1,2,3};) and non-const aggregates
‚Ä¢ .bss: zero-initialized or tentative definitions (int x; static int buf[1024];)
‚Ä¢ .ctors/.dtors (optional later): arrays of constructor/destructor function pointers for **attribute**((constructor)).

Ripple placement (banks)
‚Ä¢ Reserve bank 0: MMIO (OUT=0, OUT_FLAG=1, etc.).
‚Ä¢ Give the linker a default script that packs:
‚Ä¢ .text into a code bank region (e.g., bank 2+; you already bank program blocks)
‚Ä¢ .rodata into a read-only convention bank (e.g., bank 1)
‚Ä¢ .data and .bss into a writable bank (e.g., bank 3)
‚Ä¢ Let users override with a linker script if they want different banking.

Startup (rcrt0) responsibilities
‚Ä¢ Zero .bss:

// Pseudocode using ISA
// r0 is zero, rA/rAB are call RA banks as usual
// R3..R7 are scratch here
LI R3, **bss_start_bank
LI R4, **bss_start_addr
LI R5, **bss_end_bank
LI R6, **bss_end_addr

bss_loop:
BEQ R3, R5, bss_last_bank
bss_bank_fill:
STORE R0, R3, R4
ADDI R4, R4, 1
BLT R4, BANK_SIZE, bss_bank_fill
LI R4, 0
ADDI R3, R3, 1
JAL R0, R0, bss_loop
bss_last_bank:
BLT R4, R6, bss_last_fill
JAL R0, R0, call_main
bss_last_fill:
STORE R0, R3, R4
ADDI R4, R4, 1
JAL R0, R0, bss_last_fill
call_main:
JAL R0, R0, main
HALT

(Linker must export `__bss_*`, `BANK_SIZE`, etc.)

- \*\*Rhe linker writes initial contents directly into the runtime bank ‚Üí no copy needed.

**Linker symbols to export**

**text_start/**text_end
**rodata_start/**rodata_end
**data_start/**data_end
**bss_start/**bss_end
\_\_stack_top

**How C maps to sections (quick cheat)**

- `const char msg[] = "hi";` ‚Üí `.rodata`
- `static const int T[3] = {1,2,3};` ‚Üí `.rodata` (local symbol)
- `int x = 5;` ‚Üí `.data`
- `int x;` (global or static) ‚Üí `.bss`
- `static int y;` in a function ‚Üí `.bss` (function-local static)
- `char *p = msg;` ‚Üí `.data` (relocation to `.rodata`)
- string literals ‚Üí pooled in `.rodata` (dedup optional)

---

# Pipeline update (driver view)

rcc (driver)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rpp (preprocess) : .c + headers ‚Üí tokens / .i
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ front-end (parse/typecheck) : tokens ‚Üí AST ‚Üí IR
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ codegen : IR ‚Üí Ripple .pobj
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rasm (optional) : .s ‚Üí .pobj (if using an asm step)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rlink : .pobj ‚Üí final macro/BF image

**Objects (`.pobj`)**

- Must carry **sections**, **symbols**, and **relocations** (banks + addresses).
- Each section has `(bank_hint, alignment, contents, reloc list)`.
- The linker script (builtin or user-supplied) decides banks/addresses and fixes relocs.

---

# Minimal examples

**Headers + sections**

```c
// include/api.h
#pragma once
extern const char hello[];   // declaration only
extern int counter;          // declaration

// src/data.c
#include "api.h"
const char hello[] = "Hello, Ripple!\n";   // ‚Üí .rodata
int counter = 42;                           // ‚Üí .data
static int cache[256];                      // ‚Üí .bss

// src/main.c
#include "api.h"
int main(void) {
    // use hello/counter‚Ä¶
    return 0;
}

Build

rcc -target ripple -Iinclude -c src/data.c -o data.pobj
rcc -target ripple -Iinclude -c src/main.c -o main.pobj
rlink main.pobj data.pobj -o program.bfm

Startup guarantees (documented for users)
	‚Ä¢	All objects in .bss are zero on entry to main.
	‚Ä¢	All .data objects contain their initializers.
	‚Ä¢	.rodata is read-only by convention; the ISA doesn‚Äôt enforce it, but the toolchain won‚Äôt place stores into that bank in generated code.

‚∏ª

That should plug the holes: headers exist in the preprocessor/driver part of the plan, and .rodata/.data/.bss are now explicit in codegen, linking, and runtime. If you want, I can whip up the tiny rcrt0 you can drop into your assembler to zero .bss and call main.
```

# Calling Convention Analysis and Standardization Plan

## Executive Summary

The current calling convention implementation in `rcc-backend/src/v2/function/calling_convention.rs` contains multiple functions with overlapping responsibilities and inconsistent usage patterns. This document analyzes the current state and proposes a standardization plan to ensure a single, consistent calling convention throughout the compiler.

## Current State Analysis

### Core Functions in calling_convention.rs

1. **`analyze_placement`** (private, lines 30-63)

   - Core logic for determining register vs stack placement
   - Takes a closure to identify fat pointers
   - Returns `(register_items_with_slots, first_stack_item_index)`
   - **Good**: Reusable core logic

2. **`analyze_arg_placement`** (private, lines 66-68)

   - Wrapper around `analyze_placement` for CallArg types
   - Used by `setup_call_args`

3. **`analyze_param_placement`** (private, lines 71-74)

   - Wrapper around `analyze_placement` for IrType parameters
   - Used by `load_param`

4. **`setup_call_args`** (public, lines 80-192)

   - Sets up arguments before a function call
   - Handles both register (A0-A3) and stack arguments
   - Returns instructions but does NOT spill registers
   - **Issue**: Caller must handle spilling before calling this

5. **`emit_call`** (public, lines 195-221)

   - Generates the actual JAL instruction
   - Handles cross-bank calls by setting PCB
   - Simple and focused

6. **`handle_return_value`** (public, lines 225-260)

   - Binds return value to Rv0/Rv1 registers
   - Updates register manager with result name
   - Handles both scalar and fat pointer returns

7. **`cleanup_stack`** (public, lines 263-274)

   - Adjusts SP after call to remove arguments
   - Simple SP adjustment

8. **`make_complete_call`** (public, lines 278-335)

   - Combines setup_call_args + emit_call + handle_return_value + cleanup_stack
   - Takes numeric function address
   - **Good**: All-in-one solution

9. **`make_complete_call_by_label`** (public, lines 339-394)

   - Same as `make_complete_call` but uses label instead of address
   - **Duplication**: 90% identical to `make_complete_call`

10. **`load_param`** (public, lines 401-526)
    - Loads parameters in callee function
    - Handles both register and stack parameters
    - Manages spilling via RegisterPressureManager
    - **Complex**: Lots of offset calculations

## Usage Patterns

### Main Usage Points

1. **instruction.rs (lines 212-226)**:

   ```rust
   let cc = CallingConvention::new();
   let (call_insts, _return_regs) = cc.make_complete_call_by_label(
       mgr, naming, &func_name, call_args,
       result_type.is_pointer(), result_name,
   );
   ```

   - Uses the complete call sequence with label

2. **function.rs (lines 97-112)**:

   ```rust
   let cc = CallingConvention::new();
   for (idx, (param_id, _ty)) in function.parameters.iter().enumerate() {
       let (param_insts, preg, bank_reg) = cc.load_param(idx, &pt, mgr, naming);
       // ... binding logic
   }
   ```

   - Uses load_param for function prologue

3. **FunctionBuilder (builder.rs)**:
   - Uses individual functions: `emit_call`, `cleanup_stack`
   - Does NOT use `make_complete_call`
   - Manages its own call sequence

## Problems Identified

### 1. Duplication

- `make_complete_call` and `make_complete_call_by_label` are nearly identical
- Both calculate stack words the same way
- Both follow the same 4-step sequence

### 2. Inconsistent Interfaces

- Some code uses `make_complete_call_by_label` (instruction.rs)
- Other code builds calls manually using individual functions (FunctionBuilder)
- No single "right way" to make a call

### 3. Hidden Complexity

- `load_param` does register allocation internally
- Stack offset calculations are duplicated between setup and load
- Fat pointer handling is spread across multiple functions

### 4. Spilling Responsibility

- `setup_call_args` explicitly does NOT spill registers
- Caller must remember to spill before calling
- Easy source of bugs

### 5. Register Assignment Assumptions

- Hardcoded A0-A3 for arguments
- Hardcoded Rv0-Rv1 for returns
- Mixed use of symbolic names

## Proposed Standardization Plan

### Phase 1: Consolidate Duplicate Functions

**Action 1.1**: Merge `make_complete_call` and `make_complete_call_by_label`

```rust
pub enum CallTarget {
    Address { addr: u16, bank: u16 },
    Label(String),
}

pub fn make_complete_call(
    &self,
    mgr: &mut RegisterPressureManager,
    naming: &mut NameGenerator,
    target: CallTarget,
    args: Vec<CallArg>,
    returns_pointer: bool,
    result_name: Option<String>,
) -> (Vec<AsmInst>, Option<(Reg, Option<Reg>)>)
```

### Phase 2: Establish Clear Calling Convention Rules

**Document and enforce**:

1. First 4 scalar args OR 2 fat pointers in A0-A3
2. Mixed args: scalars and fat pointers share A0-A3 space, if the fat pointer does not fit, spill it IN FULL to the stack.
3. Remaining args on stack in reverse order
4. Return: Rv0 for scalar/address, Rv1 for bank
5. Callee-saved: S0-S3 must be preserved
6. Caller-saved: T0-T7, A0-A3 can be clobbered

### Phase 3: Create Single Entry Points

**Action 3.1**: For making calls, enforce using `make_complete_call`

- Remove public access to individual functions
- Make `setup_call_args`, `emit_call`, `cleanup_stack` private
- Keep `handle_return_value` public for special cases only

**Action 3.2**: For loading parameters, keep `load_param` as the single entry point

### Phase 4: Fix Spilling Responsibility

**Action 4.1**: Make `setup_call_args` handle spilling

- Before setting up arguments, spill all live registers
- Document this behavior clearly
- Remove the warning comment

### Phase 5: Centralize Offset Calculations

**Action 5.1**: Create shared helper for stack parameter offsets

```rust
fn calculate_stack_param_offset(
    param_index: usize,
    param_types: &[(TempId, IrType)],
    first_stack_param: usize,
) -> i16
```

### Phase 6: Improve Testing

**Action 6.1**: Add integration tests that verify:

- Calls with 0-10 arguments work correctly
- Mixed scalar/fat pointer arguments
- Stack cleanup is correct
- Return values are properly bound

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate** (Week 1):

   - Merge duplicate `make_complete_call` functions
   - Fix spilling in `setup_call_args`
   - Add helper for stack offset calculations

2. **Short-term** (Week 2):

   - Make individual call functions private
   - Update all call sites to use unified interface
   - Add comprehensive tests

3. **Medium-term** (Week 3):
   - Document calling convention formally
   - Add debug assertions for convention violations
   - Profile and optimize hot paths

## Migration Path

### Step 1: Update FunctionBuilder

```rust
// Instead of:
builder.begin_call(args)
    .emit_call(addr, bank)
    .end_call(stack_words);

// Use:
let cc = CallingConvention::new();
let (insts, regs) = cc.make_complete_call(
    mgr, naming,
    CallTarget::Address { addr, bank },
    args, returns_pointer, result_name
);
builder.add_instructions(insts);
```

### Step 2: Update all test files

- Replace manual call sequences with `make_complete_call`
- Verify tests still pass

### Step 3: Make functions private

- Change visibility of internal functions
- Ensure no external dependencies

## Success Metrics

1. **Single source of truth**: All calls go through `make_complete_call`
2. **No duplication**: No repeated logic for stack calculations
3. **Clear ownership**: Spilling handled consistently
4. **Testable**: Each aspect of calling convention has tests
5. **Documented**: Clear specification of the convention

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Breaking existing code

**Mitigation**: Gradual migration with compatibility layer

### Risk 2: Performance regression

**Mitigation**: Benchmark before/after changes

### Risk 3: Hidden dependencies

**Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite before changes

## Conclusion

The current calling convention implementation works but has significant technical debt. By consolidating duplicate functions, establishing clear interfaces, and centralizing complexity, we can create a more maintainable and reliable calling convention that serves as a solid foundation for the compiler's code generation.

The proposed changes are backwards-compatible and can be implemented incrementally, minimizing risk while improving code quality.

# Compiler-Level Floating-Point Support for Ripple VM

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for native `float` and `double` support in the RCC compiler, which will transparently lower floating-point operations to Ripple VM-compatible software implementations.

## Compiler Architecture Changes

### 1. Frontend Type System Extensions

#### Type Representation in IR

```rust
// rcc-frontend/src/ir/types.rs
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum Type {
    // Existing types
    Int(IntType),
    Pointer(Box<Type>),
    Array(Box<Type>, usize),
    Struct(String),
    // New floating-point types
    Float,      // 32-bit IEEE 754 single precision
    Double,     // 64-bit IEEE 754 double precision
}

impl Type {
    pub fn size_in_cells(&self) -> usize {
        match self {
            Type::Float => 2,   // 32 bits = 2 words
            Type::Double => 4,  // 64 bits = 4 words
            // ... existing cases
        }
    }
}
```

#### Value Representation

```rust
// rcc-frontend/src/ir/value.rs
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum Value {
    // Existing variants
    Constant(i64),
    Temp(TempId),
    Global(String),
    FatPtr(FatPointer),
    // New floating-point variants
    FloatConstant(f32),
    DoubleConstant(f64),
}
```

### 2. Frontend IR Instructions

```rust
// rcc-frontend/src/ir/instructions.rs
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum Instruction {
    // Existing instructions...

    // Floating-point arithmetic
    FAdd { result: TempId, lhs: Value, rhs: Value, ty: Type },
    FSub { result: TempId, lhs: Value, rhs: Value, ty: Type },
    FMul { result: TempId, lhs: Value, rhs: Value, ty: Type },
    FDiv { result: TempId, lhs: Value, rhs: Value, ty: Type },
    FRem { result: TempId, lhs: Value, rhs: Value, ty: Type },

    // Floating-point comparison
    FCmp { result: TempId, op: FCmpOp, lhs: Value, rhs: Value, ty: Type },

    // Conversions
    FPToSI { result: TempId, value: Value, from: Type, to: IntType },  // float to signed int
    FPToUI { result: TempId, value: Value, from: Type, to: IntType },  // float to unsigned int
    SIToFP { result: TempId, value: Value, from: IntType, to: Type },  // signed int to float
    UIToFP { result: TempId, value: Value, from: IntType, to: Type },  // unsigned int to float
    FPExt { result: TempId, value: Value },   // float to double
    FPTrunc { result: TempId, value: Value }, // double to float
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum FCmpOp {
    OEQ,  // Ordered and equal
    ONE,  // Ordered and not equal
    OLT,  // Ordered and less than
    OLE,  // Ordered and less than or equal
    OGT,  // Ordered and greater than
    OGE,  // Ordered and greater than or equal
    UEQ,  // Unordered or equal
    UNE,  // Unordered or not equal
    // ... etc
}
```

### 3. Lexer/Parser Updates

```c
// Support for float literals in lexer
float pi = 3.14159f;
double e = 2.71828;
float sci = 1.23e-4f;
double big = 6.022e23;

// Parser grammar extensions
primary_expression:
    | FLOAT_LITERAL
    | DOUBLE_LITERAL
    ;

type_specifier:
    | FLOAT
    | DOUBLE
    ;
```

### 4. Backend Lowering Strategy

#### Float Storage Layout

```rust
// rcc-backend/src/v2/float_layout.rs

/// Float representation in memory (2 words)
/// Word 0: Mantissa bits [15:0]
/// Word 1: [Sign:1][Exponent:8][Mantissa:7]
pub struct FloatLayout;

impl FloatLayout {
    pub fn store_float(value: f32) -> (u16, u16) {
        let bits = value.to_bits();
        let word0 = (bits & 0xFFFF) as u16;
        let word1 = ((bits >> 16) & 0xFFFF) as u16;
        (word0, word1)
    }

    pub fn load_float(word0: u16, word1: u16) -> f32 {
        let bits = ((word1 as u32) << 16) | (word0 as u32);
        f32::from_bits(bits)
    }
}

/// Double representation in memory (4 words)
pub struct DoubleLayout;

impl DoubleLayout {
    pub fn store_double(value: f64) -> (u16, u16, u16, u16) {
        let bits = value.to_bits();
        let word0 = (bits & 0xFFFF) as u16;
        let word1 = ((bits >> 16) & 0xFFFF) as u16;
        let word2 = ((bits >> 32) & 0xFFFF) as u16;
        let word3 = ((bits >> 48) & 0xFFFF) as u16;
        (word0, word1, word2, word3)
    }
}
```

#### Lowering Floating-Point Operations

```rust
// rcc-backend/src/v2/lower_float.rs

pub fn lower_fadd(
    mgr: &mut RegisterPressureManager,
    result: TempId,
    lhs: &Value,
    rhs: &Value,
    ty: &Type,
) -> Vec<AsmInst> {
    let mut insts = vec![];

    match ty {
        Type::Float => {
            // Load float components into registers
            let lhs_w0 = load_float_word(mgr, lhs, 0);
            let lhs_w1 = load_float_word(mgr, lhs, 1);
            let rhs_w0 = load_float_word(mgr, rhs, 0);
            let rhs_w1 = load_float_word(mgr, rhs, 1);

            // Call software float addition
            // __rcc_float_add(lhs_w0, lhs_w1, rhs_w0, rhs_w1)
            insts.push(AsmInst::Move(Reg::A0, lhs_w0));
            insts.push(AsmInst::Move(Reg::A1, lhs_w1));
            insts.push(AsmInst::Move(Reg::A2, rhs_w0));
            insts.push(AsmInst::Move(Reg::A3, rhs_w1));
            insts.push(AsmInst::Jal(Reg::Ra, "__rcc_float_add".to_string()));

            // Result in R0:R1, store to result temp
            store_float_result(mgr, result, Reg::R0, Reg::R1);
        }
        Type::Double => {
            // Similar but with 4 words per operand
            // Call __rcc_double_add
        }
        _ => panic!("Invalid type for FAdd"),
    }

    insts
}
```

### 5. Runtime Library Implementation

```c
// runtime/src/softfloat.c

// Float addition (called by compiler-generated code)
// Returns result in R0:R1
void __rcc_float_add(unsigned short a_w0, unsigned short a_w1,
                     unsigned short b_w0, unsigned short b_w1) {
    // Combine words into float representation
    float32_bits a = {.words = {a_w0, a_w1}};
    float32_bits b = {.words = {b_w0, b_w1}};

    // Extract components
    int sign_a = (a.words[1] >> 15) & 1;
    int exp_a = (a.words[1] >> 7) & 0xFF;
    unsigned int mant_a = ((a.words[1] & 0x7F) << 16) | a.words[0];

    int sign_b = (b.words[1] >> 15) & 1;
    int exp_b = (b.words[1] >> 7) & 0xFF;
    unsigned int mant_b = ((b.words[1] & 0x7F) << 16) | b.words[0];

    // Handle special cases
    if (exp_a == 0xFF) return a; // NaN or Inf
    if (exp_b == 0xFF) return b; // NaN or Inf
    if (exp_a == 0 && mant_a == 0) return b; // a is zero
    if (exp_b == 0 && mant_b == 0) return a; // b is zero

    // Align exponents
    if (exp_a < exp_b) {
        int diff = exp_b - exp_a;
        if (diff > 24) return b; // a is too small
        mant_a >>= diff;
        exp_a = exp_b;
    } else if (exp_b < exp_a) {
        int diff = exp_a - exp_b;
        if (diff > 24) return a; // b is too small
        mant_b >>= diff;
    }

    // Add or subtract based on signs
    unsigned int result_mant;
    int result_sign;
    if (sign_a == sign_b) {
        result_mant = mant_a + mant_b;
        result_sign = sign_a;
    } else {
        if (mant_a >= mant_b) {
            result_mant = mant_a - mant_b;
            result_sign = sign_a;
        } else {
            result_mant = mant_b - mant_a;
            result_sign = sign_b;
        }
    }

    // Normalize result
    int result_exp = exp_a;
    if (result_mant & 0x01000000) {
        // Overflow, shift right
        result_mant >>= 1;
        result_exp++;
    } else {
        // Normalize left
        while (result_exp > 0 && !(result_mant & 0x00800000)) {
            result_mant <<= 1;
            result_exp--;
        }
    }

    // Pack result
    __asm__("MOVE R0, %0" : : "r"(result_mant & 0xFFFF));
    __asm__("MOVE R1, %0" : : "r"((result_sign << 15) | (result_exp << 7) | ((result_mant >> 16) & 0x7F)));
}
```

### 6. Optimization Opportunities

#### Constant Folding

```rust
// During IR generation, fold float constants
match (lhs, rhs) {
    (Value::FloatConstant(a), Value::FloatConstant(b)) => {
        // Compute at compile time
        let result = a + b;
        Value::FloatConstant(result)
    }
    _ => // Generate FAdd instruction
}
```

#### Intrinsic Recognition

```rust
// Recognize patterns and use optimized implementations
// x * 2.0 -> add 1 to exponent
// x / 2.0 -> subtract 1 from exponent
// x * 1.0 -> no-op
// x + 0.0 -> copy (but handle -0.0 correctly)
```

#### Inline Expansion for Simple Operations

```rust
// For simple operations, inline instead of calling runtime
fn lower_float_negate(value: &Value) -> Vec<AsmInst> {
    // Just flip the sign bit
    let mut insts = vec![];
    let word1 = load_float_word(mgr, value, 1);
    insts.push(AsmInst::XorI(word1, word1, 0x8000)); // Flip sign bit
    insts
}
```

### 7. GEP and Memory Access

```rust
// Float arrays need special GEP handling
impl GEP {
    fn handle_float_array(&self, base: &Value, index: &Value) -> Vec<AsmInst> {
        // Each float is 2 words
        let offset = index * 2;
        // Use existing GEP with correct element size
        lower_gep(mgr, naming, base, &[offset], 2, result_temp, bank_size)
    }
}
```

### 8. ABI Considerations

```rust
// Calling convention for float parameters
// Option 1: Pass in registers (2 registers per float)
// Option 2: Pass on stack (simpler but slower)

pub struct FloatABI;

impl FloatABI {
    pub fn pass_float_arg(arg_num: usize, value: f32) -> Vec<AsmInst> {
        let (w0, w1) = FloatLayout::store_float(value);
        if arg_num < 2 {
            // First 2 floats in registers A0:A1, A2:A3
            vec![
                AsmInst::Li(Reg::from_arg(arg_num * 2), w0 as i16),
                AsmInst::Li(Reg::from_arg(arg_num * 2 + 1), w1 as i16),
            ]
        } else {
            // Rest on stack
            push_to_stack(w0, w1)
        }
    }

    pub fn return_float(value: f32) -> Vec<AsmInst> {
        let (w0, w1) = FloatLayout::store_float(value);
        vec![
            AsmInst::Li(Reg::R0, w0 as i16),
            AsmInst::Li(Reg::R1, w1 as i16),
        ]
    }
}
```

int main() {
    float a = 3.14f;
    float b = 2.71f;
    float c = a + b;

    // Should print 5.85 (approximately)
    if (c > 5.84f && c < 5.86f) {

    return 0;
}
```

### IR Generation Tests

```rust
#[test]
fn test_float_ir_generation() {
    let input = "float x = 1.0f + 2.0f;";
    let ir = parse_and_generate_ir(input);

    assert!(matches!(
        ir.instructions[0],
        Instruction::FAdd { .. }
    ));
}
```

### Backend Tests

```rust
#[test]
fn test_float_lowering() {
    let fadd = Instruction::FAdd {
        result: 0,
        lhs: Value::FloatConstant(1.0),
        rhs: Value::FloatConstant(2.0),
        ty: Type::Float,
    };

    let asm = lower_instruction(&fadd);

    // Should generate call to __rcc_float_add
    assert!(asm.iter().any(|inst|
        matches!(inst, AsmInst::Jal(_, name) if name.contains("float_add"))
    ));
}
```

## Performance Targets

| Operation     | Target Cycles | Acceptable Range |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Float Add/Sub | 50-75         | 50-100           |
| Float Mul     | 75-100        | 75-150           |
| Float Div     | 150-200       | 150-300          |
| Float Sqrt    | 200-250       | 200-400          |
| Float Sin/Cos | 300-400       | 300-600          |
| Int‚ÜíFloat     | 25-40         | 25-50            |
| Float‚ÜíInt     | 25-40         | 25-50            |

## Memory Overhead

- **Runtime library**: ~8KB for basic ops, ~16KB with full math library
- **Lookup tables**: ~2KB for optimization tables
- **Per float**: 2 words (4 bytes)
- **Per double**: 4 words (8 bytes)

## Compiler Flags

```bash
# Compilation options
rcc -msoft-float    # Use software floating point (default)
rcc -ffast-math     # Enable unsafe optimizations
rcc -fno-float      # Disable float support entirely
rcc -fsingle-precision-constant  # Treat unsuffixed float constants as float, not double
```

## ABI Documentation

### Calling Convention

- **Float arguments**: Passed in register pairs (A0:A1, A2:A3) or on stack
- **Float return**: Returned in R0:R1
- **Double arguments**: Passed in 4 registers or on stack
- **Double return**: Returned in R0:R1:R2:R3

### Structure Layout

```c
struct with_float {
    int x;      // Offset 0 (1 word)
    float y;    // Offset 1 (2 words, may need padding)
    int z;      // Offset 3 (1 word)
};  // Total: 4 words
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Performance**: Software floats are 50-100x slower than hardware
2. **Precision**: May not be fully IEEE 754 compliant in all edge cases
3. **Library size**: Full math library adds significant code size
4. **Debugging**: Harder to debug float operations in assembly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Hardware Acceleration**: MMIO-based FPU coprocessor
2. **Fixed-Point Alternative**: Compiler option for Q16.16 fixed-point
3. **Vector Operations**: SIMD-style float array operations

This document describes the JSON formats used when running the Ripple C compiler with the `--trace` flag. The trace flag generates the following JSON files for each compilation stage:

1. `filename.tokens.json` - Lexer output
2. `filename.ast.json` - Parser output
3. `filename.sem.json` - Semantic analyzer output
4. `filename.tast.json` - Typed AST
5. `filename.ir.json` - Intermediate representation

## Usage

```bash
rcc compile input.c --trace
```

This will generate all five JSON files alongside the normal compilation output.

## 1. Tokens JSON Format (`filename.tokens.json`)

Array of token objects from the lexer:

```json
[
  {
    "token_type": "Int",
    "span": {
      "start": { "line": 1, "column": 1, "offset": 0 },
      "end": { "line": 1, "column": 4, "offset": 3 }
    }
  },
  {
    "token_type": { "Identifier": "main" },
    "span": {
      "start": { "line": 1, "column": 5, "offset": 4 },
      "end": { "line": 1, "column": 9, "offset": 8 }
    }
  }
]
```

### Token Types

- Literals: `IntLiteral(i64)`, `CharLiteral(u8)`, `StringLiteral(String)`
- Keywords: `Int`, `Char`, `Return`, `If`, `While`, etc.
- Operators: `Plus`, `Minus`, `Star`, `Equal`, etc.
- Delimiters: `LeftParen`, `RightParen`, `LeftBrace`, `Semicolon`, etc.
- Special: `EndOfFile`, `Newline`

## 2. AST JSON Format (`filename.ast.json`)

Abstract syntax tree from the parser:

```json
{
  "node_id": 0,
  "items": [
    {
      "Function": {
        "node_id": 1,
        "name": "main",
        "return_type": "Int",
        "parameters": [],
        "body": {
          "node_id": 2,
          "kind": {
            "Compound": [
              {
                "node_id": 3,
                "kind": { "Return": { "IntLiteral": { "value": 0 } } },
                "span": { ... }
              }
            ]
          },
          "span": { ... }
        },
        "storage_class": "Auto",
        "span": { ... },
        "symbol_id": null
      }
    }
  ],
  "span": { ... }
}
```

### AST Node Types

- **TopLevelItem**: `Function`, `Declarations`, `TypeDefinition`
- **Statement**: `Expression`, `Compound`, `Declaration`, `If`, `While`, `For`, `Return`, etc.
- **Expression**: `IntLiteral`, `Identifier`, `Binary`, `Unary`, `Call`, `Assignment`, etc.

## 3. Semantic Analysis JSON Format (`filename.sem.json`)

Symbol table and type information after semantic analysis:

```json
{
  "symbols": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "symbol_type": "Function(Int, [])",
      "scope_level": 0
    },
    {
      "name": "x",
      "symbol_type": "Int",
      "scope_level": 1
    }
  ],
  "type_definitions": [
    {
      "name": "size_t",
      "definition": "unsigned int"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Typed AST JSON Format (`filename.tast.json`)

AST with full type information and resolved pointer arithmetic:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "Function": {
        "name": "main",
        "return_type": "Int",
        "parameters": [],
        "body": {
          "Compound": [
            {
              "Declaration": {
                "name": "x",
                "decl_type": "Int",
                "initializer": {
                  "IntLiteral": {
                    "value": 42,
                    "expr_type": "Int"
                  }
                },
                "symbol_id": 1
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Differences from AST

- All expressions have `expr_type` field
- Pointer arithmetic is explicit: `PointerArithmetic`, `PointerDifference`
- Member access includes computed offsets
- All type references are resolved

## 5. IR JSON Format (`filename.ir.json`)

Low-level intermediate representation:

```json
{
  "name": "test",
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "return_type": "I32",
      "parameters": [],
      "blocks": [
        {
          "id": 0,
          "instructions": [
            { "Store": { "ptr": "%0", "value": { "Constant": 42 } } },
            { "Return": { "value": { "Constant": 0 } } }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "is_definition": true
    }
  ],
  "globals": [
    {
      "name": "global_var",
      "var_type": "I32",
      "initializer": { "Constant": 0 },
      "is_external": false
    }
  ],
  "string_literals": []
}
```

### IR Types

- **Types**: `I8`, `I16`, `I32`, `Ptr(Type)`, `Array(Type, size)`, `Struct(fields)`
- **Instructions**: `Alloca`, `Load`, `Store`, `Binary`, `Call`, `Return`, `Branch`, etc.
- **Values**: `Constant(i64)`, `Register(id)`, `Global(name)`, `ConstantArray(values)`

## Error Handling

If the compiler encounters any AST node or feature that cannot be serialized during tracing, it will throw a `CompilerError` rather than silently skipping or using fallbacks. This ensures trace output is always complete and accurate.

## Example

Given this C file:

```c
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(3, 4);
    return result;
}
```

Running `rcc compile example.c --trace` will generate:

- `example.tokens.json` - ~50 tokens
- `example.ast.json` - Full AST with 2 functions
- `example.sem.json` - Symbol table with functions and variables
- `example.tast.json` - Typed AST with resolved types
- `example.ir.json` - IR with basic blocks and SSA instructions

- Struct initializers
- Missing ^= assignment operators
- static keyword1
- rgb mode data layout in vm

# Floating-Point Support Strategy for Ripple VM

## Overview

Ripple VM is a 16-bit architecture without native floating-point support. This document outlines strategies for implementing IEEE 754-compliant floating-point operations in software, considering the platform's word-based addressing and limited register set.

## Representation Options

### Option 1: IEEE 754 Binary32 (float) - 32-bit

**Standard single-precision format**

```
[Sign:1][Exponent:8][Mantissa:23]
Total: 32 bits (2 words in Ripple VM)
```

**Pros:**

- Industry standard compliance
- Existing algorithms available
- Good precision for most applications

**Cons:**

- Requires 2 words per float
- Complex to manipulate with 16-bit operations

### Option 2: IEEE 754 Binary16 (half) - 16-bit

**Half-precision format**

```
[Sign:1][Exponent:5][Mantissa:10]
Total: 16 bits (1 word in Ripple VM)
```

**Pros:**

- Fits in single word
- Faster operations
- Less memory usage

**Cons:**

- Limited precision (3-4 decimal digits)
- Limited range (¬±65,504)
- May not be sufficient for many applications

### Option 3: Custom 32-bit Format (Recommended)

**Optimized for 16-bit operations**

```
Word 0: [Sign:1][Exponent:7][Mantissa High:8]
Word 1: [Mantissa Low:16]
Total: 32 bits (2 words)
```

**Pros:**

- Easier to extract components with 16-bit ops
- Byte-aligned exponent
- Good balance of range and precision

**Cons:**

- Non-standard (needs conversion for I/O)
- Custom implementation required

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Type Definition

```c
// Use union for easy component access
typedef union {
    struct {
        unsigned short low;   // Mantissa low bits
        unsigned short high;  // Sign, exponent, mantissa high
    } words;
    struct {
        unsigned int mantissa : 24;  // If bit fields work
        unsigned int exponent : 7;
        unsigned int sign : 1;
    } parts;
    unsigned int raw;  // For whole-number operations
} soft_float;

// Alternative: Use struct with explicit layout
typedef struct {
    unsigned short mantissa_low;
    unsigned char mantissa_high;
    unsigned char exp_sign;  // [Sign:1][Exp:7]
} float32_t;
```

### 2. Basic Operations Structure

```c
// Addition/Subtraction algorithm
soft_float float_add(soft_float a, soft_float b) {
    // 1. Extract components
    int sign_a = extract_sign(a);
    int exp_a = extract_exponent(a);
    unsigned int mant_a = extract_mantissa(a);

    // 2. Handle special cases
    if (is_zero(a)) return b;
    if (is_zero(b)) return a;
    if (is_nan(a) || is_nan(b)) return float_nan();

    // 3. Align exponents (shift mantissa of smaller number)
    int exp_diff = exp_a - exp_b;
    if (exp_diff < 0) {
        mant_a >>= -exp_diff;
        exp_a = exp_b;
    } else {
        mant_b >>= exp_diff;
    }

    // 4. Add/subtract mantissas based on signs
    unsigned int result_mant;
    if (sign_a == sign_b) {
        result_mant = mant_a + mant_b;
    } else {
        result_mant = mant_a - mant_b;
    }

    // 5. Normalize result
    return normalize_float(sign_a, exp_a, result_mant);
}
```

### 3. Multiplication Strategy

```c
soft_float float_mul(soft_float a, soft_float b) {
    // Key challenge: 24-bit √ó 24-bit = 48-bit result
    // Solution: Break into 16-bit chunks

    // Split mantissas into high and low parts
    unsigned short a_low = a.words.low;
    unsigned short a_high = (a.words.high & 0xFF);
    unsigned short b_low = b.words.low;
    unsigned short b_high = (b.words.high & 0xFF);

    // Compute partial products (each fits in 32 bits)
    unsigned int p00 = a_low * b_low;
    unsigned int p01 = a_low * b_high;
    unsigned int p10 = a_high * b_low;
    unsigned int p11 = a_high * b_high;

    // Sum partial products with proper shifts
    unsigned int result_low = p00 + ((p01 + p10) << 8);
    unsigned int result_high = p11 + ((p01 + p10) >> 8);

    // Add exponents
    int result_exp = extract_exponent(a) + extract_exponent(b) - BIAS;

    // XOR signs
    int result_sign = extract_sign(a) ^ extract_sign(b);

    return normalize_float(result_sign, result_exp, result_high);
}
```

## Memory Layout Considerations

### Word-Based Addressing Impact

```c
// Storing floats in arrays needs careful alignment
typedef struct {
    unsigned short data[2];  // Two words per float
} float_storage;

// Array access pattern
float_storage float_array[100];

// Reading a float
soft_float read_float(int index) {
    soft_float result;
    result.words.low = float_array[index].data[0];
    result.words.high = float_array[index].data[1];
    return result;
}
```

### Bank Crossing Considerations

```c
// Large float arrays may span banks
// GEP will handle this automatically
float_storage *large_array = malloc(1000 * sizeof(float_storage));
// This could span multiple banks, but GEP handles indexing
```

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Table-Driven Approaches

```c
// Precomputed tables for common operations
static const unsigned short recip_table[256];  // 1/x approximations
static const unsigned short sqrt_table[256];   // sqrt approximations
static const short exp_table[128];             // 2^x for small x

// Fast reciprocal approximation
soft_float fast_recip(soft_float x) {
    int exp = extract_exponent(x);
    unsigned int mant = extract_mantissa(x);

    // Table lookup for mantissa reciprocal
    unsigned char index = mant >> 16;  // Top 8 bits
    unsigned short recip_approx = recip_table[index];

    // Adjust exponent
    int result_exp = BIAS - (exp - BIAS);

    // One Newton-Raphson iteration for accuracy
    return newton_raphson_recip(x, recip_approx, result_exp);
}
```

### 2. Fixed-Point Fallback

```c
// For many operations, fixed-point may be sufficient
typedef struct {
    int whole;      // Integer part
    unsigned short frac;  // Fractional part (0.16 format)
} fixed32_t;

// Faster than float for add/subtract
fixed32_t fixed_add(fixed32_t a, fixed32_t b) {
    fixed32_t result;
    unsigned int frac_sum = a.frac + b.frac;
    result.frac = frac_sum & 0xFFFF;
    result.whole = a.whole + b.whole + (frac_sum >> 16);
    return result;
}
```

### 3. Compiler Intrinsics

```c
// Compiler could recognize patterns and optimize
#define FLOAT_ADD(a, b) __builtin_float_add(a, b)
#define FLOAT_MUL(a, b) __builtin_float_mul(a, b)

// Backend generates optimized instruction sequences
```

## Testing Strategy

### Compliance Tests

```c
// test_ieee_compliance.c
void test_float_special_cases() {
    soft_float zero = float_from_int(0);
    soft_float one = float_from_int(1);
    soft_float inf = float_inf();
    soft_float nan = float_nan();

    // Test special case arithmetic
    assert(float_is_inf(float_div(one, zero)));
    assert(float_is_nan(float_mul(zero, inf)));
    assert(float_is_nan(float_add(inf, float_neg(inf))));
}
```

### Precision Tests

```c
// test_float_precision.c
void test_float_accuracy() {
    // Test against known values
    soft_float pi = float_from_string("3.14159265");
    soft_float e = float_from_string("2.71828183");

    soft_float result = float_mul(pi, e);
    // Should be approximately 8.5397342

    float error = float_to_native(float_sub(result, float_from_string("8.5397342")));
    assert(fabs(error) < 0.0001);
}
```

### Performance Benchmarks

```c
// benchmark_float_ops.c
void benchmark_float_operations() {
    soft_float a = float_from_int(12345);
    soft_float b = float_from_int(67890);

    // Time 1000 operations
    unsigned int start = get_cycle_count();
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        a = float_add(a, b);
    }
    unsigned int cycles = get_cycle_count() - start;

    printf("Float add: %u cycles/op\n", cycles / 1000);
}
```

## Platform-Specific Optimizations

### 1. Leverage 16-bit multiply

```c
// Ripple VM has MUL instruction for 16√ó16‚Üí16
// Use for partial products in float multiplication
unsigned int mul32(unsigned short a_high, unsigned short a_low,
                   unsigned short b_high, unsigned short b_low) {
    // Each multiplication fits in 16-bit result
    unsigned short ll = a_low * b_low;
    unsigned short lh = a_low * b_high;
    unsigned short hl = a_high * b_low;
    unsigned short hh = a_high * b_high;

    // Combine with shifts
    return (hh << 16) + ((lh + hl) << 8) + ll;
}
```

### 2. Use shift instructions efficiently

```c
// For normalization, use native shift operations
soft_float normalize(unsigned int mantissa, int exponent) {
    // Count leading zeros (could be optimized with CLZ if available)
    int shift = 0;
    while (!(mantissa & 0x800000)) {
        mantissa <<= 1;
        shift++;
    }

    exponent -= shift;
    return pack_float(0, exponent, mantissa);
}
```

### 3. Bank-aware float arrays

```c
// Store float arrays to minimize bank crossings
typedef struct {
    float_storage floats[2048];  // Fits in one bank
} float_bank;

// Allocate per-bank for better locality
float_bank *banks[4];  // 4 banks of floats
```

## Compiler Integration

### Frontend Support

```c
// Compiler recognizes float type and generates soft-float calls
float a = 3.14f;  // Generates: soft_float a = float_from_literal(0x4048F5C3);
float b = a * 2;  // Generates: soft_float b = float_mul(a, float_from_int(2));
```

### Backend Optimization

- Recognize common patterns (multiply by 2 = add exponent)
- Inline simple operations
- Use specialized sequences for constants

## Alternative: Q-Number Fixed Point

For applications that don't need full float:

```c
// Q16.16 format (32-bit fixed point)
typedef struct {
    short integer;
    unsigned short fraction;
} q16_16_t;

// Much faster operations
q16_16_t q_mul(q16_16_t a, q16_16_t b) {
    int result = ((int)a.integer << 16 | a.fraction) *
                 ((int)b.integer << 16 | b.fraction);
    return (q16_16_t){result >> 32, result >> 16};
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **Start with IEEE 754 binary32** for compatibility
2. **Implement in C first**, optimize later with assembly
3. **Provide both float and fixed-point** options
4. **Use lookup tables** for transcendental functions
5. **Consider hardware acceleration** via MMIO coprocessor (future)

## Resource Requirements

- **Code size**: ~8KB for basic operations, ~16KB with math library
- **Data size**: ~2KB for lookup tables
- **Stack usage**: ~32 words for complex operations
- **Performance**: 50-200 cycles per operation (estimated)

VM Implementation Notes

1. Load hook
   Intercept reads for words 0..8: return dynamic values.
   Words 9..31: return 0 for now.
   Words 32..1031: read from memory[].
2. Store hook
   Intercept writes for TTY_OUT, DISP_MODE, DISP_CTL, DISP_FLUSH.
   Words 2/TTY_IN_POP are read-only (ignore stores).
   Words 9..31: ignore for now.
   Words 32..1031: write-through to memory[].
3. TTY timing
   On TTY_OUT store: emit low8, set TTY_STATUS=0 for one VM step (or immediately restore to 1 if you want zero-latency), then TTY_STATUS=1.
4. Display
   ‚Ä¢ DISP_CTL.CLEAR: zero memory[32..1031], then auto-clear that bit, keep ENABLE latched.
   ‚Ä¢ DISP_FLUSH=1: clear DISP_STATUS.flush_done, render 40√ó25 cells from memory[32..1031], then set flush_done and ensure ready=1.
   ‚Ä¢ If DISP_MODE!=TEXT40 or !ENABLE, FLUSH is a no-op (but still sets flush_done=1).
5. RNG
   Each RNG read advances state and returns a u16. For now always seeded by host with a fixed PRNG (e.g., LCG).
6. Banking
   Devices and VRAM are defined only in bank 0. Ignore bank register for these addresses.

Rationale
‚Ä¢ BF-fast: fixed header indices with no pointer math; VRAM at a constant base (32).
‚Ä¢ No discovery needed: dimensions and offsets are constant by contract.

Ripple VM MMIO Storage Specification

Device: Word-Addressed RAMdisk with Commit

Overview

The Ripple VM provides a persistent block storage device via four MMIO registers in the Bank 0 header.
The design exposes a flat 16-bit word‚Äìaddressed disk, structured as:
‚Ä¢ 65536 blocks (selected via 16-bit register)
‚Ä¢ 65536 words per block (addressed via 16-bit register)
‚Ä¢ Each word = 16 bits

Total Addressable Capacity:

65536 blocks √ó 65536 words √ó 2 bytes = 8 GiB

This layout balances simplicity (only 4 registers) with power (large address space).

‚∏ª

MMIO Header Mapping

Address Name R/W Description
17 HDR_STORE_BLOCK W Select current block (0‚Äì65535)
18 HDR_STORE_ADDR W Select word address within block (0‚Äì65535)
19 HDR_STORE_DATA R/W Data register: read/write 16-bit word at (BLOCK, ADDR)
20 HDR_STORE_CTL R/W Control register (busy/dirty/commit bits, see below)

‚∏ª

Register Details

HDR_STORE_BLOCK (W)
‚Ä¢ 16-bit value selecting active block number (0‚Äì65535).
‚Ä¢ All reads/writes to HDR_STORE_DATA apply to this block.

HDR_STORE_ADDR (W)
‚Ä¢ 16-bit value selecting word address inside block (0‚Äì65535).
‚Ä¢ After each access to HDR_STORE_DATA, ADDR auto-increments by 1 (wraps at 0xFFFF).
‚Ä¢ This allows sequential streaming without repeatedly setting ADDR.

HDR_STORE_DATA (R/W)
‚Ä¢ Read: returns 16-bit word at (BLOCK, ADDR).
‚Ä¢ Write: updates 16-bit word at (BLOCK, ADDR) and marks block as dirty.
‚Ä¢ Auto-increments ADDR after each operation.

HDR_STORE_CTL (R/W)

Bit Name Description
0 BUSY Read-only. 1 if VM is processing a storage operation.
1 DIRTY Read/write. Set = current block has uncommitted writes.
2 COMMIT Write-only. Writing 1 triggers commit of current block.
3 COMMIT_ALL Write-only. Writing 1 triggers commit of all dirty blocks.
15‚Äì4 Reserved Reads as 0.

‚∏ª

Operation Model

Read Word

1. Write BLOCK to HDR_STORE_BLOCK.
2. Write word address to HDR_STORE_ADDR.
3. Read HDR_STORE_DATA.

Write Word

1. Write BLOCK to HDR_STORE_BLOCK.
2. Write word address to HDR_STORE_ADDR.
3. Write data to HDR_STORE_DATA.
4. VM sets DIRTY=1 for that block.

Commit Block

1. Write 0b100 (bit 2) to HDR_STORE_CTL.
2. VM flushes the dirty block (128 KB) to host backing store.
3. VM clears DIRTY flag.

Commit All

1. Write 0b1000 (bit 3) to HDR_STORE_CTL.
2. VM flushes all dirty blocks to host backing store.
3. VM clears all DIRTY flags.

‚∏ª

Backing Store Implementation
‚Ä¢ Host File: Backed by a sparse file up to 8 GiB.
‚Ä¢ Block Offset Calculation:

host_offset = (BLOCK √ó 65536 + ADDR) √ó 2 bytes

    ‚Ä¢	Commit Granularity: Commit operations flush dirty blocks (128 KB each) for persistence.
    ‚Ä¢	Dirty Tracking: Host maintains a 65,536-bit bitmap (8 KB) to track dirty blocks.

‚∏ª

Example Usage

Writing a String to Block 42

; Set block 42
LI A0, 42
LI T1, 17 ; HDR_STORE_BLOCK
STORE A0, R0, T1

; Start at address 0
LI A0, 0
LI T1, 18 ; HDR_STORE_ADDR
STORE A0, R0, T1

; Write 'H'
LI A0, 'H'
LI T1, 19 ; HDR_STORE_DATA
STORE A0, R0, T1

; Write 'i'
LI A0, 'i'
STORE A0, R0, T1 ; Auto-increment address

; Commit
LI A0, 0b100 ; bit 2 = commit current block
LI T1, 20 ; HDR_STORE_CTL
STORE A0, R0, T1

Reading Back

; Set block 42, address 0
LI A0, 42
STORE A0, R0, 17
LI A0, 0
STORE A0, R0, 18

; Read first char
LI T1, 22
LOAD A0, T0, T1 ; A0 = 'H'

‚∏ª

Design Rationale

1. Simplicity: Only 4 registers control the entire 8 GiB space.
2. Streaming-Friendly: Auto-increment address supports efficient block I/O.
3. Commit Semantics: Allows deterministic persistence points (block or all).
4. Scalability: Large logical capacity; sparse file avoids huge host usage.
5. Flexibility: Can layer FAT16/FAT32 or custom FS over the raw block device.

Gotcha‚Äîhere‚Äôs a step-by-step, spill-only register assignment algorithm (no virtual regs) tailored to your Ripple ISA.

Assumptions & Conventions
‚Ä¢ Hardware regs:
‚Ä¢ R0 = 0
‚Ä¢ RA/RAB used by JAL/JALR (untouchable by allocator)
‚Ä¢ Chosen calling convention (simple):
‚Ä¢ SP = R14, FP = R15, SB = R13 (stack bank id), GB = R12 (globals/rodata bank)
‚Ä¢ Return value in R3
‚Ä¢ Caller-saved: all allocatable regs
‚Ä¢ Allocatable pool: POOL = [R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11]
‚Ä¢ Word size: 1 cell (your ISA semantics); array index scale folded into offset calc
‚Ä¢ Memory ops: LOAD rd, bankReg, addrReg / STORE rs, bankReg, addrReg

Stack Frame Layout (per function)

FP+0 .. FP+L-1 : locals
FP+L .. FP+L+S-1 : spill slots (temps)

Sizes L and S are known after local/temporary planning.

Prologue

ADD FP, SP, R0
ADDI SP, SP, -(L+S)

Epilogue

ADD SP, FP, R0
JALR R0, R0, RA

Data Structures

Free = stack/list of regs from POOL
MapRegToSlot[reg] = spill-slot offset or ‚ä•
MapValToSlot[id] = spill-slot offset or ‚ä• ; optional if you want to reload specific temps
LRU = queue of ‚Äúin-use‚Äù regs (most-recently-used at tail)

Helper Routines

AddrLocal(offset) ‚Üí r

r ‚Üê getReg()
ADD r, FP, R0
ADDI r, r, offset
return r

AddrGlobal(offset) ‚Üí r

r ‚Üê getReg()
LI r, offset
; if absolute addressing not desired, do ADD to a GP base instead
return r

spill(reg)

slot ‚Üê MapRegToSlot[reg]
if slot = ‚ä• then
slot ‚Üê fresh_spill_slot()
MapRegToSlot[reg] ‚Üê slot
tmp ‚Üê getScratchAddr(slot) ; uses R12 as scratch
STORE reg, SB, tmp
mark reg free (but don‚Äôt push to Free yet; caller will overwrite)

reload(slot) ‚Üí reg

reg ‚Üê getReg()
tmp ‚Üê getScratchAddr(slot)
LOAD reg, SB, tmp
return reg

getScratchAddr(slot) ‚Üí rTmp

ADD R12, FP, R0
ADDI R12, R12, (L + slot)
return R12

getReg() ‚Üí reg

if Free not empty: reg ‚Üê pop(Free); push reg into LRU; return reg
victim ‚Üê pickVictim(LRU) ; LRU front
spill(victim)
push victim back to Free
reg ‚Üê pop(Free); push reg into LRU; return reg

freeReg(reg)

remove reg from LRU
MapRegToSlot[reg] stays as-is (for potential reload)
push reg to Free

pickVictim(LRU)
Return the least-recently-used reg from LRU (front). (FIFO works too.)

Expression Codegen (Sethi‚ÄìUllman + greedy)

Define need(n):

need(Const/LoadLocal/LoadGlobal/LoadPtr) = 1
need(Unary u) = need(child)
need(Binary b) =
if need(L)=need(R) then need(L)+1 else max(need(L), need(R))

EmitExp(n) ‚Üí reg

switch kind(n):
case Const(k):
r ‚Üê getReg()
LI r, k
return r

case LoadLocal(off):
addr ‚Üê AddrLocal(off)
r ‚Üê getReg()
LOAD r, SB, addr
freeReg(addr)
return r

case LoadGlobal(off):
addr ‚Üê AddrGlobal(off)
r ‚Üê getReg()
LOAD r, GB, addr
freeReg(addr)
return r

case LoadPtr(ptrExp, byteOff):
rp ‚Üê EmitExp(ptrExp)
if byteOff ‚â† 0: ADDI rp, rp, byteOff
r ‚Üê getReg()
LOAD r, SB_or_GB_from_provenance(ptrExp), rp
freeReg(rp)
return r

case Unary(op, x):
rx ‚Üê EmitExp(x)
; apply op using available ISA (e.g., NOT via XORI, NEG via SUB)
return rx ; in-place

case Binary(op, a, b):
; order children by need(): evaluate larger first
if need(a) < need(b) then swap(a,b)

    ra ‚Üê EmitExp(a)
    rb ‚Üê EmitExp(b)

    switch op:
      case '+': ADD  ra, ra, rb
      case '-': SUB  ra, ra, rb
      case '&': AND  ra, ra, rb
      case '|': OR   ra, ra, rb
      case '^': XOR  ra, ra, rb
      case '<<': SL  ra, ra, rb
      case '>>': SR  ra, ra, rb
      case '<':  SLT ra, ra, rb
      case 'u<': SLTU ra, ra, rb
      ; if op not in ISA (e.g., MUL): call helper or emit loop

    freeReg(rb)
    return ra

Statement Codegen

StoreLocal(off, exp)

rv ‚Üê EmitExp(exp)
addr ‚Üê AddrLocal(off)
STORE rv, SB, addr
freeReg(rv); freeReg(addr)

StoreGlobal(off, exp) ‚Äî same but bank = GB

StorePtr(ptrExp, byteOff, valExp)

rp ‚Üê EmitExp(ptrExp)
if byteOff ‚â† 0: ADDI rp, rp, byteOff
rv ‚Üê EmitExp(valExp)
STORE rv, SB_or_GB_from_provenance(ptrExp), rp
freeReg(rv); freeReg(rp)

If / While conditions

rc ‚Üê EmitExp(cond)
BEQ rc, R0, label_false_or_exit
freeReg(rc)
; then/loop body...

At statement boundaries: all temporaries must be either stored (if needed) or freed. No temps cross basic blocks.

Calls

Before JAL

; Spill everything conservatively (simple & correct)
for each reg in LRU: spill(reg); freeReg(reg)
; Evaluate args and place per ABI (e.g., on stack or in R5..R8)
JAL bankImm, addrImm
; Result expected in R3 (by convention)

(When you track ‚Äúlive‚Äù flags later, you can avoid spilling dead regs.)

Branching & Joins
‚Ä¢ Because temps never cross statements/blocks, no merge mapping is required.
‚Ä¢ Values that must survive are in memory (locals/globals) and are reloaded when needed.

Function Return
‚Ä¢ Place return value in R3 and R4 before epilogue.
‚Ä¢ Emit epilogue (restore SP, JALR R0,R0,RA).

Bank Selection for Pointers
‚Ä¢ At compile time, each pointer expression carries its provenance: SB (stack) or GB (globals/rodata).
‚Ä¢ LOAD/STORE pick SB or GB accordingly. (If mixed is possible, carry a (bank,value) pair in codegen, or normalize pointers into a known region.)

Correctness Guarantees
‚Ä¢ When out of regs, you spill to the frame‚Äîalways correct.
‚Ä¢ Before calls, all temps are spilled‚Äîno clobber.
‚Ä¢ Across branches, only memory persists‚Äîno reg mismatch at joins.

# Pointer Arithmetic Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the necessary changes to properly handle pointer arithmetic in the Ripple C compiler. Currently, the IR layer and V2 backend have full support for pointer arithmetic through GEP (GetElementPtr) instructions with bank overflow handling. However, the frontend (AST ‚Üí IR) needs to be enhanced to generate GEP instructions instead of regular arithmetic for pointer operations.

**Key Insight**: All pointer arithmetic MUST go through GEP to ensure proper bank overflow handling in our segmented memory architecture (4096-instruction banks).

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Already Working

#### IR Layer (`rcc-frontend/src/ir/` - moved from rcc-ir)

- **GetElementPtr instruction** fully defined with fat pointer support
- **IrBuilder methods** for pointer operations:
  - `build_pointer_offset()` - Basic pointer arithmetic
  - `build_pointer_offset_with_bank()` - With explicit bank control
- **Fat pointer representation** with address and bank components
- **Proper type system** distinguishing pointers from integers

#### V2 Backend (`rcc-backend/src/v2/instr/gep.rs`)

- **Complete GEP lowering** with bank overflow detection
- **Static optimization** for compile-time known offsets
- **Dynamic runtime handling** using DIV/MOD for bank calculations
- **Comprehensive tests** covering all edge cases
- **V1 backend removed** - Only clean V2 implementation remains

### ‚ùå What's Missing

#### Frontend (AST ‚Üí IR Lowering)

- **No type-aware arithmetic** - Treats `ptr + int` as regular addition
- **No GEP generation** for pointer operations
- **No element size scaling** - Doesn't multiply by sizeof(element)
- **No array indexing lowering** - Doesn't convert `arr[i]` to GEP

## The Problem: Why This Matters

### Example: Array Crossing Bank Boundary

```c
int arr[2000];  // 8000 bytes, spans 2 banks!
int *p = &arr[0];
int *q = p + 1500;  // Should cross into bank 1
int value = *q;     // Must load from correct bank!
```

#### Current (WRONG) Behavior

```llvm
; Frontend generates:
%q = add i16 %p, 1500  ; Just adds 1500, not 1500*4!
; No bank update!
; Result: WRONG ADDRESS, WRONG BANK, CRASH!
```

#### Correct Behavior with GEP

```llvm
; Frontend should generate:
%q = getelementptr i16* %p, i32 1500  ; Scales by sizeof(int)=4
; Backend handles bank overflow:
; offset = 1500 * 4 = 6000
; new_bank = 0 + (6000 / 4096) = 1
; new_addr = 6000 % 4096 = 1904
; Result: Bank 1, Offset 1904 ‚úì
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Frontend Type System Enhancement

#### Task 1.1: Add Type Information to Expression Nodes

**File to modify**: `rcc-frontend/src/ast.rs` (or equivalent)

```rust
pub enum TypedExpr {
    Binary {
        op: BinaryOp,
        left: Box<TypedExpr>,
        right: Box<TypedExpr>,
        expr_type: Type,  // Add type information
    },
    // ...
}
```

#### Task 1.2: Implement Type Checker

**File to create**: `rcc-frontend/src/type_checker.rs`

```rust
pub fn check_expr(expr: &Expr, env: &TypeEnv) -> Result<TypedExpr, TypeError> {
    match expr {
        Expr::Binary { op: Add, left, right } => {
            let left_typed = check_expr(left, env)?;
            let right_typed = check_expr(right, env)?;

            match (&left_typed.get_type(), &right_typed.get_type()) {
                (Type::Pointer(elem), Type::Integer) => {
                    // Pointer arithmetic!
                    Ok(TypedExpr::PointerArithmetic {
                        ptr: Box::new(left_typed),
                        offset: Box::new(right_typed),
                        elem_type: elem.clone(),
                    })
                }
                (Type::Integer, Type::Integer) => {
                    // Regular arithmetic
                    Ok(TypedExpr::Binary {
                        op: Add,
                        left: Box::new(left_typed),
                        right: Box::new(right_typed),
                        expr_type: Type::Integer,
                    })
                }
                _ => Err(TypeError::InvalidOperands)
            }
        }
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Phase 2: IR Generation with GEP

#### Task 2.1: Modify IR Builder Usage

**File to modify**: `rcc-frontend/src/ir_gen.rs` (or equivalent)

```rust
pub fn lower_expr(expr: &TypedExpr, builder: &mut IrBuilder) -> Result<Value, Error> {
    match expr {
        TypedExpr::PointerArithmetic { ptr, offset, elem_type } => {
            // Generate GEP instead of Add!
            let ptr_val = lower_expr(ptr, builder)?;
            let offset_val = lower_expr(offset, builder)?;
            let result_type = IrType::FatPtr(Box::new(elem_type.to_ir()));

            // Use the existing IrBuilder method!
            builder.build_pointer_offset(ptr_val, offset_val, result_type)
        }
        TypedExpr::Binary { op: Add, left, right, expr_type: Type::Integer } => {
            // Regular integer addition
            let lhs = lower_expr(left, builder)?;
            let rhs = lower_expr(right, builder)?;
            builder.build_binary(IrBinaryOp::Add, lhs, rhs, IrType::I16)
        }
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Task 2.2: Handle Array Indexing

```rust
TypedExpr::ArrayIndex { array, index } => {
    let array_ptr = lower_expr(array, builder)?;
    let index_val = lower_expr(index, builder)?;

    // Generate GEP for address calculation
    let elem_ptr = builder.build_pointer_offset(
        array_ptr,
        index_val,
        array.elem_type.to_ir()
    )?;

    // Then load from that address
    builder.build_load(elem_ptr, array.elem_type.to_ir())
}
```

#### Task 2.3: Handle Struct Field Access

```rust
TypedExpr::FieldAccess { struct_ptr, field_name } => {
    let ptr = lower_expr(struct_ptr, builder)?;
    let field_info = get_field_info(struct_ptr.get_type(), field_name)?;

    // Field offset is compile-time constant
    let offset = Value::Constant(field_info.offset_in_elements);

    // Generate GEP for field access
    builder.build_pointer_offset(ptr, offset, field_info.type.to_ir())
}
```

### Phase 3: Pointer Arithmetic Operations

#### Task 3.1: Pointer Subtraction

```rust
TypedExpr::PointerDifference { ptr1, ptr2, elem_type } => {
    // ptr1 - ptr2 returns number of elements between them
    let p1 = lower_expr(ptr1, builder)?;
    let p2 = lower_expr(ptr2, builder)?;

    // Calculate byte difference
    let byte_diff = builder.build_binary(IrBinaryOp::Sub,
                                         get_addr(p1),
                                         get_addr(p2),
                                         IrType::I16)?;

    // Divide by element size to get element count
    let elem_size = Value::Constant(elem_type.size_in_bytes());
    builder.build_binary(IrBinaryOp::UDiv,
                        Value::Temp(byte_diff),
                        elem_size,
                        IrType::I16)
}
```

#### Task 3.2: Pointer Comparisons

```rust
TypedExpr::PointerComparison { op, ptr1, ptr2 } => {
    // Must consider both address AND bank!
    let p1 = lower_expr(ptr1, builder)?;
    let p2 = lower_expr(ptr2, builder)?;

    // For pointers in same bank, compare addresses
    // For pointers in different banks, compare banks first
    // This needs special handling in backend
    generate_bank_aware_comparison(builder, op, p1, p2)
}
```

### Phase 4: Testing Strategy

#### Task 4.1: Unit Tests for Type Checker

```rust
#[test]
fn test_pointer_arithmetic_typing() {
    // int *p; p + 5 should be typed as pointer arithmetic
    let expr = parse("p + 5");
    let typed = type_check(expr, &env).unwrap();
    assert!(matches!(typed, TypedExpr::PointerArithmetic { .. }));
}
```

#### Task 4.2: IR Generation Tests

```rust
#[test]
fn test_pointer_arithmetic_generates_gep() {
    // int *p; p + 5 should generate GEP instruction
    let ir = lower_to_ir("int *p; p + 5;");
    assert!(ir.contains_instruction(|i|
        matches!(i, Instruction::GetElementPtr { .. })
    ));
}
```

#### Task 4.3: End-to-End Tests

Create test files in `c-test/tests/`:

```c
// test_pointer_arithmetic.c
void putchar(int c);

int main() {
    int arr[10] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    int *p = arr;
    int *q = p + 5;  // Should point to arr[5]

    if (*q == 5) {
        putchar('Y');  // Success
    } else {
        putchar('N');  // Failure
    }
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}
```

```c
// test_bank_crossing.c
void putchar(int c);

int main() {
    int huge_array[2000];  // Spans multiple banks
    huge_array[0] = 42;
    huge_array[1500] = 99;  // In different bank!

    int *p = &huge_array[0];
    int *q = p + 1500;  // Must handle bank crossing

    if (*q == 99) {
        putchar('Y');  // Success - read from correct bank
    } else {
        putchar('N');  // Failure - wrong bank/address
    }
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}
```

- [x] Convert struct field access to GEP - ‚úÖ COMPLETED Dec 2024

### Phase 3: Operations

- [x] Implement pointer subtraction (returns element count) - Implemented `TypedBinaryOp::PointerDifference`
- [x] Implement pointer comparisons (bank-aware) - Implemented `TypedBinaryOp::Comparison` with `is_pointer_compare` flag
- [x] Handle NULL pointer checks - Not yet implemented
- [ ] Support pointer casts - Not yet implemented

### Phase 4: Testing

- [ ] Type checker unit tests
- [ ] IR generation tests
- [ ] Bank crossing tests
- [ ] Full test suite passes

## Critical Requirements

### MUST Have

1. **All pointer arithmetic through GEP** - Never use regular Add/Sub
2. **Element size scaling** - Multiply offset by sizeof(element)
3. **Bank overflow handling** - Let GEP handle bank boundaries
4. **Type safety** - Can't add two pointers, can't multiply pointers

### Should Have

1. **Optimization** - Use shift for power-of-2 element sizes
2. **Bounds checking** - Optional runtime array bounds checks
3. **Null checks** - Detect NULL pointer dereference

### Nice to Have

1. **Pointer provenance tracking** - For advanced optimizations
2. **Alias analysis** - Determine if pointers might alias
3. **Escape analysis** - Optimize stack allocations

## Common Pitfalls

### ‚ùå DON'T

- Generate `Add(ptr, int)` - Always use GEP
- Forget element size scaling - `p+1` means next element, not next byte
- Ignore bank boundaries - They're critical for correctness
- Mix pointer and integer arithmetic freely

### ‚úÖ DO

- Type check all expressions before IR generation
- Use `build_pointer_offset()` for all pointer arithmetic
- Test with arrays that span bank boundaries
- Verify element size calculations

## Benefits of Proper Implementation

1. **Correctness**: Programs work correctly across bank boundaries
2. **Safety**: Type system prevents invalid pointer operations
3. **Optimization**: Backend can optimize GEP patterns
4. **Debugging**: Clear separation of pointer vs integer ops
5. **Portability**: Clean IR that could target other architectures

## Example: Complete Flow

### C Code

```c
int arr[2000];
int value = arr[1500];
```

### After Type Checking

```
TypedExpr::ArrayIndex {
    array: TypedExpr::Variable { name: "arr", type: Pointer(I32) },
    index: TypedExpr::Constant { value: 1500, type: I32 }
}
```

### Generated IR

```llvm
%ptr = getelementptr [2000 x i32], [2000 x i32]* @arr, i32 0, i32 1500
%value = load i32, i32* %ptr
```

### V2 Backend Assembly

```asm
; Calculate offset: 1500 * 4 = 6000
LI R3, 1500
LI R4, 4
MUL R5, R3, R4

; Calculate bank crossing
LI R6, 4096
DIV R7, R5, R6    ; R7 = 1 (crossed 1 bank)
MOD R8, R5, R6    ; R8 = 1904 (offset in new bank)

; Load from Bank 1, Offset 1904
ADD R9, GP, R7    ; R9 = bank register (GP + 1)
LOAD R10, R9, R8  ; Load value using correct bank
```

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 0**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (December 2024)
- **Phase 1**: Type System - 1 week
- **Phase 2**: IR Generation - 1 week
- **Phase 3**: Operations - 3 days
- **Phase 4**: Testing - 3 days

**Total**: ~3 weeks for complete implementation

## Ready for Next Phase

With Phase 0 complete, the codebase is now properly structured for implementing pointer arithmetic:

- IR definitions are in the frontend where type information is available
- Backend contains only the V2 implementation with proven GEP support
- Clean separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- All infrastructure in place for type-aware code generation

## Conclusion

Array and Struct Access ‚Üí Direct Mapping to C Semantics

In C, array indexing and struct member access have direct semantic equivalents that naturally lower to GetElementPtr (GEP) in IR.

Key Rule
‚Ä¢ arr[i] is exactly _(arr + i) in C.
‚Ä¢ struct_ptr->field is exactly _((char\*)struct_ptr + field_offset).

Implication for Lowering
‚Ä¢ Array indexing should never be compiled as raw pointer addition; it should be lowered to GEP(base_ptr, index) where the backend multiplies index by sizeof(element) and applies bank overflow rules.
‚Ä¢ Struct field access should be lowered to GEP(struct_ptr, constant_offset_in_elements) ‚Äî the offset is known at compile-time from the struct layout.

Why This Matters
‚Ä¢ This approach ensures correct scaling by element size.
‚Ä¢ It automatically handles segmented/banked memory (because GEP is the only place bank overflow logic is implemented).
‚Ä¢ It keeps IR type-safe ‚Äî index stays an integer, base stays a pointer.
‚Ä¢ It aligns perfectly with the C standard definition of these operators, so the compiler‚Äôs behavior matches programmer expectations.

Practical Lowering Pattern

// C:
x = arr[i];

// IR (conceptual):
%elem_ptr = getelementptr i32* %arr, i32 %i
%x = load i32, i32* %elem_ptr

Takeaway
Never special-case arrays or structs in backend assembly generation ‚Äî always route them through the same GEP lowering path used for general pointer arithmetic.

Remember: **Every pointer arithmetic operation must go through GEP!**

# RCC-IR Conformance Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the conformance of the RCC-IR compiler implementation to the Ripple VM Calling Convention specification. The analysis covers register allocation, function handling, pointer representation, memory operations, and calling conventions.

## Conformance Analysis

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Register Allocation (simple_regalloc.rs)

**Status: MOSTLY CONFORMANT WITH ISSUES**

**Conformant aspects:**

- Implementation correctly uses R5-R11 as allocatable pool (lines 46, 290-294, 391-394, 430)
- Uses R12 as scratch register for spill address calculation (correct)
- R14 (SP) and R15 (FP) are properly excluded from allocation
- Implements spilling mechanism with LRU-like selection
- Correctly preserves parameter registers across statement boundaries

**Critical Issues:**

- **R13 NEVER INITIALIZED**: The code uses R13 as stack bank register but NEVER sets it to 1!
  - All spill/reload operations use uninitialized R13
  - This would cause all stack operations to fail
- **Misleading comment**: Line 12 says "R3-R11" but implementation correctly uses only R5-R11
- **Not true LRU**: Uses first non-pinned register, not actual least-recently-used tracking

### ‚ùå Function Prologue/Epilogue (lower/functions.rs)

**Status: NON-CONFORMANT**

**Critical Issue:**

- **R13 (stack bank) is NEVER initialized to 1**
- Prologue/epilogue use R13 as bank register but it contains garbage
- ALL stack operations would fail

**Structure matches spec but broken due to uninitialized R13:**

**Prologue** (lines 192-216):

```asm
; MISSING: LI R13, 1    ; Initialize stack bank!!!
STORE RA, R13, R14    ; Save RA at SP (R13 uninitialized!)
ADDI R14, R14, 1      ; Increment SP
STORE R15, R13, R14   ; Save old FP (R13 uninitialized!)
ADDI R14, R14, 1      ; Increment SP
ADD R15, R14, R0      ; FP = SP
ADDI R14, R14, space  ; Reserve stack space
```

**Epilogue** (lines 219-230):

```asm
ADD R14, R15, R0      ; SP = FP (restore)
ADDI R14, R14, -1     ; Decrement SP
LOAD R15, R13, R14    ; Restore old FP (R13 uninitialized!)
ADDI R14, R14, -1     ; Decrement SP
LOAD RA, R13, R14     ; Restore RA (R13 uninitialized!)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pointer Handling (Fat Pointers)

**Status: PARTIALLY CONFORMANT**

**Conformant aspects:**

- Fat pointer structure with address and bank components (FatPtrComponents struct)
- Bank tag values: 0 for Global, 1 for Stack (matches spec)
- Pointer parameters passed as two values (address, bank)
- Pointer returns use R3 (address) and R4 (bank)
- GEP operations preserve bank tags

**Non-conformant/Missing aspects:**

- Bank tag is tracked separately via `bank_temp_key` rather than being fully integrated
- No explicit handling for bank overflow in GEP operations (critical safety issue)
- Mixed pointer provenance not fully handled (would error rather than work)

### ‚ùå Memory Operations (LOAD/STORE)

**Status: NON-CONFORMANT**

**Critical Issues:**

- **WRONG BANK REGISTER USAGE**:
  - `get_bank_for_pointer` returns R0 for global (correct) but a register with value `1` for stack
  - Should return R13 (stack bank register) for stack, not a register containing `1`
  - Inconsistent usage: Sometimes uses R13 directly, sometimes uses value from `get_bank_for_pointer`

**Load operations** (lower/instr/load.rs):

- Uses `LOAD rd, bank_reg, addr_reg` format (correct structure)
- Handles fat pointer loads (loading both address and bank)
- **BROKEN**: Bank register is wrong for stack operations

**Store operations** (lower/instr/store.rs):

- Uses `STORE rs, bank_reg, addr_reg` format (correct structure)
- Handles fat pointer stores (storing both address and bank)
- **BROKEN**: Bank register is wrong for stack operations
- Inconsistent: func.rs:212 uses R13 directly, but store.rs uses `get_bank_for_pointer`

### ‚ùå Calling Convention

**Status: NON-CONFORMANT**

**Critical Non-conformance:**

- **WRONG REGISTER USAGE**: Implementation uses R3-R8 for parameters, but R3 is reserved for return values!
- According to spec: R3 = return value, R4 = second return/pointer bank
- Parameters should likely use R5-R11 or a different convention
- This is a **fundamental ABI mismatch** that would break interoperability

**Conformant aspects:**

- Fat pointers passed as two consecutive values (for parameters)
- Proper argument shuffling to avoid conflicts (lines 143-199)
- All registers considered caller-saved

**Additional Non-conformance:**

- **BROKEN POINTER RETURNS**: Return only puts address in R3, NOT bank in R4!
- Pointer returns are completely broken - missing bank information

**Other issues:**

- No callee-saved registers (spec says "none" but could be clearer)
- Stack parameters at incorrect offsets (should account for saved RA/FP)
- No support for varargs (spec says "not yet supported")

### ‚úÖ Register Numbering

**Status: CONFORMANT**

The implementation uses the correct hardware register numbers as defined in the specification. The Reg enum in the codebase matches the numbering in types.rs.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Completely Broken Calling Convention ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå

**SEVERE ABI VIOLATIONS**:

**A. Wrong Parameter Registers**:

- Implementation uses R3-R8 for parameters
- But R3-R4 are reserved for return values!
- Parameters should use R5-R11 (or different convention)

**B. Broken Pointer Returns**:

- Implementation only returns address in R3
- **Completely missing bank tag in R4 for pointer returns**
- This means returned pointers are unusable!

**Impact**:

- Functions cannot correctly return pointers
- Parameter passing conflicts with return values
- Total ABI incompatibility

**Fix Required**:

- Implement proper fat pointer returns (R3=addr, R4=bank)
- Move parameters to R5-R11 or revise convention
- This is blocking any real use of the compiler

### 2. R13 Stack Bank Register NEVER INITIALIZED ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå

**CATASTROPHIC**: R13 is supposed to be the stack bank register but is NEVER set to 1:

- ALL prologue/epilogue operations use uninitialized R13
- ALL spill/reload operations use uninitialized R13
- ALL stack memory access would fail with garbage bank value
- The entire stack mechanism is completely broken

### 3. Wrong Bank Register Usage ‚ùå

**SEVERE**: Memory operations use wrong bank registers:

- `get_bank_for_pointer` loads value `1` into a register for stack bank
- Should return R13 (the stack bank register) directly
- Inconsistent: Sometimes uses R13, sometimes uses `get_bank_for_pointer` result

### 4. Bank Overflow in GEP ‚ùå

The implementation does not handle bank boundary crossing in pointer arithmetic. This could lead to memory corruption when arrays span banks.

**Recommendation**: Implement bank-aware GEP as specified in the "Bank Safety Considerations" section.

### 5. Mixed Pointer Provenance ‚ö†Ô∏è

The current implementation would error on mixed pointer provenance rather than handling it at runtime.

**Recommendation**: Implement runtime bank tracking for mixed provenance cases.

## Minor Deviations

### 1. Bank Tag Storage

Bank tags are stored separately using `bank_temp_key` rather than being fully integrated into the value system.

**Impact**: Low - functionality is correct but code is more complex.

### 2. Spill Slot Management

Spill slots are managed correctly but the offset calculation could be clearer about the relationship to the frame layout.

**Impact**: Low - works correctly but could be better documented.

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Implement bank-aware GEP**: Add overflow checking and proper bank calculation for arrays spanning banks
2. **Document bank tag flow**: Add clear documentation about how bank tags flow through the compiler
3. **Add safety assertions**: Add runtime checks for bank boundary violations in debug builds

### Medium Priority

1. **Unify pointer representation**: Consider fully integrating fat pointers into the value system
2. **Improve spill slot documentation**: Document the exact frame layout including spill slots
3. **Add mixed provenance support**: Implement runtime bank selection for mixed provenance

### Low Priority

1. **Optimize register allocation**: Consider implementing callee-saved registers for better performance
2. **Add varargs support**: Implement variable argument lists when needed
3. **Improve parameter passing**: Consider register-based parameter passing for first N arguments

## Conclusion

The RCC-IR implementation has **significant non-conformance** issues with the Ripple VM Calling Convention, most critically in the parameter passing mechanism. While some core mechanics like register allocation and memory operations are correct, the fundamental ABI violation makes this implementation incompatible with the specification.

Main issues requiring immediate attention:

1. **Completely broken calling convention** (CRITICAL - ABI BREAKING)
2. **R13 never initialized - ALL stack access broken** (CATASTROPHIC)
3. **Wrong bank register usage** (CRITICAL - MEMORY ACCESS BROKEN)
4. **Bank boundary safety in pointer arithmetic** (CRITICAL - MEMORY SAFETY)
5. **Mixed pointer provenance handling** (IMPORTANT)

Overall conformance score: **20%**

The implementation cannot be considered conformant until the parameter passing ABI is fixed. This is not just a safety issue but a fundamental compatibility problem that would prevent interoperability with correctly implemented code.

- switch to 32 registers

# Ripple VM Calling Convention

CRITICAL! VM is 16-bit. There is no way to store two separate 8-bit values in a single 16-bit register.
All the values (char, etc) are stored in 16-bit, and the calling convention is designed to handle this.

## Register Assignments

### Register Numbering (Hardware)

```
R0  = 0   // Always zero
PC  = 1   // Program counter
PCB = 2   // Program counter bank
RA  = 3   // Return address
RAB = 4   // Return address bank
R3  = 5   // General purpose
R4  = 6   // General purpose
R5  = 7   // General purpose
R6  = 8   // General purpose
R7  = 9   // General purpose
R8  = 10  // General purpose
R9  = 11  // General purpose
R10 = 12  // General purpose
R11 = 13  // General purpose
R12 = 14  // General purpose
R13 = 15  // General purpose
R14 = 16  // General purpose
R15 = 17  // General purpose
```

### Special Purpose Registers

- **R0** (0): Always zero (hardware constraint)
- **PC** (1): Program counter
- **PCB** (2): Program counter bank
- **RA** (3): Return address register (used by JAL/JALR)
- **RAB** (4): Return address bank

### Convention Registers

- **R3** (5): Return value register (or pointer address for fat pointers)
- **R4** (6): Second return value (or pointer bank for fat pointers)
- **R5-R11** (7-13): General purpose, allocatable registers (7 registers)
- **R12** (14): Scratch register - reserved for address calculations during spill/reload
- **R13** (15): Stack bank register (SB) - holds bank ID for stack (initialized to 1)
- **R14** (16): Stack pointer (SP)
- **R15** (17): Frame pointer (FP)

### Register Classes

- **Caller-saved**: R3-R11 (return values and allocatable registers)
- **Callee-saved**: None in current convention
- **Allocatable pool**: [R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11]
- **Reserved**: R12 (scratch), R13 (SB), R14 (SP), R15 (FP)

## Stack Frame Layout

```
Higher addresses
+----------------+
| Previous frame |
+================+ <- FP (Frame Pointer)
| Local vars     |
| FP+0 .. FP+L-1 |
+----------------+
| Spill slots    |
| FP+L .. FP+L+S-1|
+----------------+ <- SP (Stack Pointer)
| Next frame     |
+----------------+
Lower addresses
```

Where:

- L = number of local variable slots
- S = number of spill slots for temporaries

## Function Prologue

```asm
; Initialize stack bank register (if not already set)
LI    R13, 1            ; SB = 1 (stack in bank 1)

; Set up frame
ADD   FP, SP, R0        ; Set frame pointer to current stack pointer
ADDI  SP, SP, -(L+S)    ; Allocate stack frame
```

Note: R13 initialization may be done once at program start rather than in every function.
R12 is reserved as a scratch register for spill/reload address calculations.

## Function Epilogue

```asm
ADD   SP, FP, R0        ; Restore stack pointer
JALR  R0, R0, RA        ; Return to caller
```

## Calling Convention

### Before Call

1. Spill all live registers (conservative approach for M3/M4)
2. Evaluate arguments
3. Pass arguments according to ABI (stack-based for now)

### Call Instruction

```asm
JAL bankImm, addrImm    ; Sets RA/RAB, jumps to function
```

### After Call

- **Scalar result (16-bit)**: In R3
- **Pointer result**: Address in R3, bank in R4 (fat pointer)
- **32-bit result**: Low 16 bits in R3, high 16 bits in R4
- All caller-saved registers are considered clobbered
- Reload any spilled values as needed

### Fat Pointer Format

Pointers consist of two components:

- **Address**: Memory address within bank
- **Bank tag**: Identifies memory region

### Bank Tag Values

- `0`: Global memory (.rodata/.data) - use R0 for bank (always reads 0)
- `1`: Stack memory (frame/alloca) - stored in R13 (SB)
- `2`: Reserved for future heap

### Bank Register Usage

- **R0**: Used for global bank access (globals are in bank 0, R0 always reads 0)
- **R12**: Reserved as scratch register for address calculations during spill/reload
- **R13 (SB)**: Initialize to 1 at program/function start for stack in bank 1

### Pointer Parameter Passing

When passing pointer parameters:

1. Pass address in first register
2. Pass bank tag in second register
3. Maintain this order consistently

### Pointer Return Values

Return pointers as two register values:

- **R3**: Pointer address
- **R4**: Bank tag
- This applies to all pointer-returning functions

## Memory Operations

### Load from Pointer

```asm
LOAD rd, bankReg, addrReg
```

Where:

- `rd`: Destination register
- `bankReg`: Register containing bank ID (R13 for stack, R0 for globals, or dynamic)
- `addrReg`: Register containing address

### Store to Pointer

```asm
STORE rs, bankReg, addrReg
```

Where:

- `rs`: Source register
- `bankReg`: Register containing bank ID (R13 for stack, R0 for globals, or dynamic)
- `addrReg`: Register containing address

### Pointer Arithmetic (GEP)

- **CRITICAL**: Address arithmetic must respect bank boundaries
- Bank register must be preserved through arithmetic
- Formula: `addr' = addr + index * element_size`
- **Bank Overflow Handling**:
  - Option 1: Error on compile-time detectable overflow
  - Option 2: Wrap within bank (modulo bank_size)
  - Option 3: Runtime bounds checking
- **Recommendation**: For arrays spanning banks, use explicit bank calculation:
  ```asm
  ; For large arrays crossing banks:
  total_offset = base_addr + (index * element_size)
  new_bank = base_bank + (total_offset / bank_size)
  new_addr = total_offset % bank_size
  ```

## Spilling Strategy

### Spill Slot Allocation

- Spill slots start at FP+L
- Each spilled register gets a unique slot
- Slots are word-sized (1 cell)

### Spill Operation

```asm
ADD   R12, FP, R0       ; R12 is dedicated scratch for address calc
ADDI  R12, R12, (L+slot); Calculate spill address
STORE reg, R13, R12     ; Store to stack (R13 = SB)
```

### Reload Operation

```asm
ADD   R12, FP, R0       ; R12 is dedicated scratch for address calc
ADDI  R12, R12, (L+slot); Calculate spill address
LOAD  reg, R13, R12     ; Load from stack (R13 = SB)
```

## Register Allocation Algorithm

### LRU-based Allocation

1. Maintain free list of available registers
2. Track LRU queue of in-use registers
3. When out of registers:
   - Select victim (least recently used)
   - Spill victim to stack
   - Reuse victim's register

### Expression Evaluation Order (Sethi-Ullman)

1. Calculate register need for each subexpression
2. Evaluate higher-need subexpression first
3. This minimizes total register pressure

## Addressing Modes

### Local Variable Access

```asm
ADD   r, FP, R0         ; Base = frame pointer
ADDI  r, r, offset      ; Add local offset
LOAD  result, SB, r     ; Load from stack bank
```

### Global Variable Access

```asm
LI    r, offset         ; Load global address
LOAD  result, R0, r     ; Load from global bank (R0 reads 0, globals in bank 0)
```

## Inter-procedural Considerations

### Parameter Areas

- Currently stack-based parameter passing
- Future: First N parameters in registers

### Variable Arguments

- Not yet supported
- Future: Passed on stack after fixed parameters

### Struct Returns

- **Small structs (‚â§1 word)**: In R3
- **Small structs (2 words)**: Low word in R3, high word in R4
- **Pointers**: Address in R3, bank in R4
- **Large structs (>2 words)**: Caller allocates, passes hidden pointer

## Optimizations

### Leaf Functions

- Functions that don't call others
- Can skip saving RA/RAB
- May use simplified prologue/epilogue

### Tail Calls

- Replace epilogue + call with:

```asm
JAL   bankImm, addrImm  ; Direct tail call
```

## Debugging Support

### Stack Walking

- FP forms linked list of frames
- Each frame has predictable layout
- Enables backtrace functionality

### Variable Location

- Locals: FP + known offset
- Spills: FP + L + spill_slot
- Temporaries: In registers or spilled

## Instruction Set Architecture

## Bank Safety Considerations

### Bank Boundary Issues

- **Problem**: Simple address arithmetic can overflow bank boundaries
- **Example**: Array at bank[0]:4090 with 8-byte elements will overflow at index 1
- **Solutions**:
  1. **Static Analysis**: Compiler tracks maximum offsets and warns/errors
  2. **Bank-aware GEP**: Calculate bank crossings explicitly
  3. **Contiguous Virtual Addressing**: Abstract over banks in compiler

### Safe Array Access Pattern

For arrays that might span banks:

```asm
; Given: base_bank, base_addr, index, element_size
; Calculate absolute offset
MUL   R5, index, element_size
ADD   R5, R5, base_addr

; Calculate bank offset (assuming power-of-2 bank_size)
SRL   R6, R5, log2(bank_size)  ; bank_offset = total / bank_size
ADD   R6, R6, base_bank         ; new_bank = base_bank + bank_offset

; Calculate address within bank
ANDI  R5, R5, (bank_size - 1)  ; new_addr = total % bank_size

; Now safe to access
LOAD  result, R6, R5
```

### Compiler Strategies

1. **Small Objects**: Guarantee single-bank allocation
2. **Large Arrays**: Use virtual addressing with bank calculation
3. **Stack Arrays**: Limit size or use heap-like allocation
4. **String Literals**: Pack efficiently but track bank crossings

# Ripple VM Standard Library Expansion Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a phased approach to expand the Ripple VM standard library, focusing on implementing a robust memory allocator and essential C standard library functions. The plan addresses the unique constraints of the 16-bit architecture with word-based addressing and fat pointers.

## Phase 0: Compiler Prerequisites Investigation (Week 0)

### Objective

Verify that the RCC compiler supports all language features required for the chosen hybrid memory allocator implementation and identify any missing features that need to be implemented first.

### Required Compiler Features to Verify

#### 1. Pointer Arithmetic

- [ ] **Fat pointer arithmetic preservation** - Verify bank tags are maintained
- [ ] **Pointer comparison** - Required for boundary checks
- [ ] **Pointer subtraction** - Required for block size calculations
- [ ] **Void pointer casting** - Essential for generic allocator interface

**Test Code:**

```c
// test_ptr_arithmetic_malloc.c
void test_pointer_requirements() {
    void *p1 = (void*)0x1000;
    void *p2 = (void*)0x2000;

    // Test pointer comparison
    if (p2 > p1) putchar('Y'); else putchar('N');

    // Test pointer arithmetic
    char *cp = (char*)p1;
    cp += 100;
    if ((void*)cp > p1) putchar('Y'); else putchar('N');

    // Test pointer difference
    int diff = (char*)p2 - (char*)p1;
    if (diff == 0x1000) putchar('Y'); else putchar('N');
}
```

#### 2. Structure Support

- [ ] **Nested structures** - Required for free list management
- [ ] **Structure pointers in structures** - Self-referential structures
- [ ] **Structure assignment** - Block header manipulation
- [ ] **Bit fields (optional)** - For flags optimization

**Test Code:**

```c
// test_struct_malloc.c
struct block {
    unsigned short size;
    unsigned short flags;
    struct block *next;
    struct block *prev;
};

void test_struct_requirements() {
    struct block b1 = {16, 0x5A00, 0, 0};
    struct block b2;

    // Structure assignment
    b2 = b1;
    if (b2.size == 16) putchar('Y'); else putchar('N');

    // Self-referential pointers
    b1.next = &b2;
    b2.prev = &b1;
    if (b1.next->prev == &b1) putchar('Y'); else putchar('N');
}
```

#### 3. Union Support

- [ ] **Basic unions** - Memory reuse in block structures
- [ ] **Unions with pointers** - Free list overlay

**Test Code:**

```c
// test_union_malloc.c
union block_data {
    struct {
        void *next;
        void *prev;
    } free;
    char user_data[32];
};

void test_union_requirements() {
    union block_data block;
    block.free.next = (void*)0x1234;

    // Verify union overlay
    if (*(unsigned short*)block.user_data == 0x1234)
        putchar('Y');
    else
        putchar('N');
}
```

#### 4. Static Variables

- [ ] **Static local variables** - Heap state management
- [ ] **Static initialization** - One-time heap init

**Test Code:**

```c
// test_static_malloc.c
void *get_heap_start() {
    static void *heap_start = (void*)0x1000;
    static int initialized = 0;

    if (!initialized) {
        initialized = 1;
        putchar('I'); // Initialized
    }

    return heap_start;
}

void test_static_requirements() {
    void *p1 = get_heap_start(); // Should print 'I'
    void *p2 = get_heap_start(); // Should not print 'I'

    if (p1 == p2) putchar('Y'); else putchar('N');
}
```

#### 5. Type Casting

- [ ] **void* to char* conversions** - Byte-level access
- [ ] **Integer to pointer conversions** - Address manipulation
- [ ] **Pointer to integer conversions** - Size calculations

#### 6. Inline Assembly (Optional but Useful)

- [ ] **Memory fence instructions** - For thread safety (future)
- [ ] **Efficient bit operations** - For bitmap management

#### 7. Extended Bank Access

- [ ] **LOAD with bank operand** - Cross-bank memory reads
- [ ] **STORE with bank operand** - Cross-bank memory writes
- [ ] **Register X3/X4 availability** - Reserved registers for heap
- [ ] **Inline assembly for bank operations** - Direct bank access

**Test Code:**

```c
// test_bank_access_malloc.c
void test_bank_operations() {
    // Test inline assembly for cross-bank access
    unsigned short value = 0x1234;
    unsigned short bank = 4;
    unsigned short addr = 0x1000;

    // Store to bank 4
    __asm__("STORE %0, %1, %2" : : "r"(value), "r"(bank), "r"(addr));

    // Load from bank 4
    unsigned short result;
    __asm__("LOAD %0, %1, %2" : "=r"(result) : "r"(bank), "r"(addr));

    if (result == 0x1234) putchar('Y'); else putchar('N');
}
```

### Memory Layout Design - Extended Multi-Bank Heap

#### Multi-Bank Heap Architecture

Using LOAD/STORE with explicit bank operands and reserved registers X3/X4 for heap management:

```
Bank 3 (Primary Heap):
[0x0000-0x00FF] Heap metadata (global state, bank allocation table)
[0x0100-0x0FFF] Small allocations (4-64 words)
[0x1000-0x3FFF] Medium allocations (64-512 words)

Bank 4-7 (Extended Heap):
[0x0000-0x3FFF] Large allocations (512+ words)
Total: 4 banks √ó 16KB = 64KB extended heap

Bank 8-15 (Optional Ultra-Large Heap):
[0x0000-0x3FFF] Very large allocations
Total: 8 banks √ó 16KB = 128KB maximum heap
```

#### Register Allocation Strategy

```
X3: Current heap bank selector (for cross-bank operations)
X4: Heap metadata pointer (always points to bank 3)
```

#### Cross-Bank Pointer Format

```c
// Extended fat pointer for multi-bank heap
typedef struct {
    unsigned short addr;    // Address within bank
    unsigned char bank;     // Bank number (3-15)
    unsigned char flags;    // Allocation flags
} heap_ptr_t;
```

## Appendix A: Extended Multi-Bank Allocator Implementation

### Overview

The allocator leverages Ripple VM's bank-aware GEP implementation and LOAD/STORE with explicit bank operands to manage a heap spanning multiple banks (up to 192KB total).

### Key Design Elements

#### 1. Bank-Aware Pointer Structure

```c
// runtime/src/malloc.c

// Extended pointer with bank tracking
typedef struct heap_ptr {
    unsigned short addr;    // Address within bank
    unsigned short bank;    // Bank number (3-15)
} heap_ptr_t;

// Block header for allocations
typedef struct block_header {
    unsigned short size;        // Size in words
    unsigned short flags;       // Bits: [15:8]=magic, [7:1]=reserved, [0]=free
    heap_ptr_t next;           // Next block in free list
    heap_ptr_t prev;           // Previous block in free list
} block_header_t;

// Global heap metadata (stored at bank 3, address 0x0000)
typedef struct heap_meta {
    heap_ptr_t free_lists[NUM_BINS];  // Segregated free lists
    unsigned short bank_map[13];       // Bitmap of used banks (3-15)
    unsigned short total_free;         // Total free words
    unsigned short total_allocated;    // Total allocated words
    unsigned short num_allocations;    // Number of active allocations
    unsigned short largest_free;       // Largest contiguous free block
} heap_meta_t;
```

#### 2. Cross-Bank Operations Using X3/X4

```c
// Inline assembly helpers for cross-bank access
static inline unsigned short load_from_bank(unsigned short bank, unsigned short addr) {
    unsigned short value;
    __asm__ volatile(
        "MOVE X3, %1\n"        // Load bank into X3
        "LOAD %0, X3, %2\n"    // Load from [bank:addr]
        : "=r"(value)
        : "r"(bank), "r"(addr)
        : "X3"
    );
    return value;
}

static inline void store_to_bank(unsigned short bank, unsigned short addr, unsigned short value) {
    __asm__ volatile(
        "MOVE X3, %1\n"        // Load bank into X3
        "STORE %2, X3, %0\n"   // Store to [bank:addr]
        :
        : "r"(addr), "r"(bank), "r"(value)
        : "X3"
    );
}

// Helper to read block header from any bank
static block_header_t read_block_header(heap_ptr_t ptr) {
    block_header_t header;
    unsigned short base_addr = ptr.addr;

    header.size = load_from_bank(ptr.bank, base_addr);
    header.flags = load_from_bank(ptr.bank, base_addr + 1);
    header.next.addr = load_from_bank(ptr.bank, base_addr + 2);
    header.next.bank = load_from_bank(ptr.bank, base_addr + 3);
    header.prev.addr = load_from_bank(ptr.bank, base_addr + 4);
    header.prev.bank = load_from_bank(ptr.bank, base_addr + 5);

    return header;
}
```

#### 3. Allocation Strategy

```c
void *malloc(int size) {
    // Convert bytes to words (round up)
    unsigned short words = (size + 1) / 2;
    unsigned short total_words = words + HEADER_SIZE;

    // Align to minimum block size
    if (total_words < MIN_BLOCK_SIZE) {
        total_words = MIN_BLOCK_SIZE;
    }

    // Load metadata from bank 3
    __asm__ volatile("MOVE X4, 3");  // X4 = metadata bank
    heap_meta_t *meta = (heap_meta_t *)0x0000;

    // Determine allocation strategy based on size
    if (total_words <= 64) {
        // Small allocation - use segregated lists in bank 3
        return alloc_small(meta, total_words);
    } else if (total_words <= 512) {
        // Medium allocation - use bank 3 large area
        return alloc_medium(meta, total_words);
    } else {
        // Large allocation - find available bank (4-15)
        return alloc_large_multibank(meta, total_words);
    }
}

// Large allocation across banks
static void *alloc_large_multibank(heap_meta_t *meta, unsigned short words) {
    // Find contiguous banks if needed
    unsigned short banks_needed = (words + BANK_SIZE - 1) / BANK_SIZE;

    if (banks_needed == 1) {
        // Single bank allocation
        for (int bank = 4; bank <= 15; bank++) {
            if (!(meta->bank_map[bank - 3] & 0x8000)) {  // Check if bank is free
                // Allocate from this bank
                heap_ptr_t ptr = {0x0000, bank};

                // Mark bank as used
                meta->bank_map[bank - 3] = 0x8000 | words;

                // Set up block header
                block_header_t header = {
                    .size = words,
                    .flags = MAGIC_ALLOCATED,
                    .next = {0, 0},
                    .prev = {0, 0}
                };
                write_block_header(ptr, &header);

                // Return user pointer (skip header)
                return make_fat_pointer(bank, HEADER_SIZE);
            }
        }
    } else {
        // Multi-bank allocation (very large)
        // Find contiguous free banks
        for (int start_bank = 4; start_bank <= 16 - banks_needed; start_bank++) {
            if (can_allocate_banks(meta, start_bank, banks_needed)) {
                return alloc_multibank(meta, start_bank, banks_needed, words);
            }
        }
    }

    return NULL;  // Out of memory
}
```

#### 4. Compiler Integration

```c
// Helper to create fat pointer that compiler understands
static void *make_fat_pointer(unsigned short bank, unsigned short addr) {
    // This creates a fat pointer with proper bank tagging
    // The compiler will track this through its GEP implementation
    void *result;
    __asm__ volatile(
        "MOVE X3, %1\n"        // Bank in X3
        "MOVE %0, %2\n"        // Address in result
        "# FAT_PTR bank=X3"    // Compiler hint
        : "=r"(result)
        : "r"(bank), "r"(addr)
        : "X3"
    );
    return result;
}
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Phase 0 Tests - Verify Bank Operations

```c
// test_bank_operations.c
void test_cross_bank_access() {
    // Test direct bank access
    store_to_bank(4, 0x1000, 0x1234);
    unsigned short val = load_from_bank(4, 0x1000);
    if (val == 0x1234) putchar('Y'); else putchar('N');

    // Test X3/X4 preservation
    __asm__("MOVE X3, 5");
    __asm__("MOVE X4, 6");
    store_to_bank(7, 0x2000, 0x5678);
    unsigned short x3_val, x4_val;
    __asm__("MOVE %0, X3" : "=r"(x3_val));
    __asm__("MOVE %0, X4" : "=r"(x4_val));

    // X3 should be modified (7), X4 preserved (6)
    if (x3_val == 7) putchar('Y'); else putchar('N');
    if (x4_val == 6) putchar('Y'); else putchar('N');
}
```

#### Integration with GEP

Since the compiler's GEP implementation is already bank-aware:

1. Pointers returned by malloc will have proper bank tags
2. Array indexing will automatically handle bank crossings
3. The compiler tracks bank info through BankInfo enum

### Performance Considerations

1. **Bank Switching Overhead**: Minimize by segregating sizes
2. **Metadata Access**: Keep in bank 3 with X4 as dedicated pointer
3. **Coalescing**: Only within same bank to avoid complexity
4. **Free List Management**: Per-bank free lists for O(1) operations

## Appendix B: Compiler Architecture Integration

### Frontend GEP Model

The RCC compiler follows the LLVM model where all pointer arithmetic is handled through GetElementPtr (GEP) instructions in the frontend IR. This provides several advantages for the standard library implementation:

1. **Separation of Concerns**

   - Frontend: Handles all type-aware pointer arithmetic
   - Backend: Handles bank boundary crossing and fat pointer management
   - Runtime: Can focus on allocation strategy without pointer arithmetic complexity

2. **Type Safety**

   - GEP ensures type-correct pointer arithmetic
   - Element sizes are computed at compile time
   - Array bounds can be checked statically when possible

3. **Bank Transparency for Library Code**

   ```c
   // In malloc implementation, this code:
   block_header_t *next = current + 1;

   // Becomes in IR:
   // %next = getelementptr %current, 1

   // Backend automatically handles:
   // - Computing offset (1 * sizeof(block_header_t))
   // - Checking for bank overflow
   // - Updating bank register if needed
   ```

### Implications for Standard Library

#### Memory Functions

Since pointer arithmetic is handled by GEP, memory functions can be simpler:

```c
void memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, int n) {
    char *d = (char*)dest;
    const char *s = (const char*)src;

    // Simple loop - GEP handles bank crossing
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        d[i] = s[i];  // GEP handles d+i and s+i
    }
}
```

#### String Functions

String operations benefit from automatic bank handling:

```c
int strlen(const char *s) {
    int len = 0;
    // GEP handles s+len across banks
    while (s[len] != '\0') {
        len++;
    }
    return len;
}
```

#### Malloc Implementation

The allocator can treat pointers as opaque:

```c
typedef struct block {
    struct block *next;  // GEP handles dereferencing
    struct block *prev;  // Even across banks
    unsigned short size;
    unsigned short flags;
} block_t;

void *malloc(int size) {
    block_t *current = free_list;

    while (current) {
        if (current->size >= size) {
            // Split block if needed
            if (current->size > size + MIN_BLOCK) {
                // GEP computes new block address
                block_t *new_block = (block_t*)((char*)current + size + sizeof(block_t));
                new_block->size = current->size - size - sizeof(block_t);
                // ...
            }
            return (char*)current + sizeof(block_t);
        }
        current = current->next;  // GEP handles traversal
    }

    // Allocate from new bank if needed
    return alloc_from_new_bank(size);
}
```

### Compiler Support Requirements

#### Required Features (Phase 0 Verification)

1. ‚úì **GEP with bank overflow** - Already implemented in backend
2. ‚úì **Fat pointer tracking** - BankInfo enum tracks through compilation
3. ? **Inline assembly** - For bank-specific operations
4. ? **Volatile operations** - For MMIO and metadata access
5. ? **Static variables** - For heap state
6. ? **Function pointers** - For atexit handlers

#### Nice-to-Have Features

1. **Builtin memcpy** - Compiler could optimize block copies
2. **Builtin memset** - Compiler could optimize memory clearing
3. **Bank hints** - Pragma to suggest bank allocation

### Testing the Integration

```c
// test_gep_malloc_integration.c
void test_malloc_with_gep() {
    // Allocate array
    int *arr = (int*)malloc(100 * sizeof(int));

    // Fill array - GEP handles indexing
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        arr[i] = i * i;  // May cross banks transparently
    }

    // Verify - GEP handles reading
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        if (arr[i] != i * i) {
            putchar('N');
            return;
        }
    }

    putchar('Y');
    free(arr);
}

# Type System Prerequisites Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Before implementing the pointer arithmetic features outlined in POINTER_ARITHMETIC_ROADMAP.md, we need to establish a complete type system foundation. This document outlines the prerequisite features that must be implemented first.

**UPDATE (Dec 2024)**: Analysis reveals that much of the symbol table infrastructure already exists but is disconnected from the typed AST conversion layer!

**Key Discovery**:

- ‚úÖ Symbol type tracking exists: `SemanticAnalyzer::symbol_types`
- ‚úÖ Typedef support exists: `SemanticAnalyzer::type_definitions`
- ‚úÖ Type resolution works in semantic analysis
- ‚ùå But `TypeEnvironment` can't access any of this!

**Bottom Line**: Phase 1 is now just a 1-2 day wiring task instead of a week-long implementation!

## Current State Analysis (UPDATED January 2025)

### ‚úÖ What Already Exists (More Than Expected!)

1. **Symbol Type Tracking**

   - `SemanticAnalyzer` has `symbol_types: HashMap<SymbolId, Type>`
   - Stores types for all functions, globals, parameters, and local variables
   - `ExpressionAnalyzer::analyze()` (in `semantic/expressions/analyzer.rs`) fills in `expr_type` on all expressions
   - Symbol lookup and type assignment works during semantic analysis

2. **Typedef Support**

   - `type_definitions: HashMap<String, Type>` stores typedef mappings
   - `SymbolManager::declare_global_variable()` handles `typedef` storage class
   - `TypeAnalyzer::resolve_type()` resolves typedef names to concrete types
   - Already functional in semantic analysis!

3. **Symbol Resolution**

   - `SymbolTable` from rcc_common provides scoped symbol management
   - Symbols are properly tracked with enter_scope()/exit_scope()
   - Symbol IDs are assigned and stored in AST nodes

4. **Unified Type Checking Architecture** ‚úÖ NEW (January 2025)
   - Eliminated dual type checking system (removed `TypeChecker` module)
   - All type checking now happens in `ExpressionAnalyzer` (modularized in `semantic/expressions/`) during semantic analysis
   - Typed AST conversion trusts semantic analysis results (no re-checking)
   - Improved consistency and reduced code duplication

### ‚úÖ Resolved Issues (January 2025)

1. **TypeEnvironment Connection** ‚úÖ FIXED

   - `TypeEnvironment` properly accesses `symbol_types` from semantic analysis
   - Type information flows correctly through compilation pipeline

2. **Cast Expression Support** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

   - Parser fully supports cast expressions `(type)expression`
   - Type name parsing for abstract declarators
   - Codegen for all cast types (pointer, integer, void\*)

3. **Core Struct Implementation** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Struct layout calculation with field offsets
   - Member access parsing for `.` and `->` operators
   - Nested struct support with proper type resolution
   - Chained member access (`obj.inner.field`) works correctly
   - Struct pointer member fields fully supported

### üü° Partial Implementations

1. **Advanced Struct Features**

   - ‚ùå Array fields in structs (causes type errors)
   - ‚ùå Complex struct scenarios (test_struct_evil.c)
   - ‚úÖ Basic/intermediate struct patterns work perfectly

2. **Typedef in Declarations**
   - ‚úÖ Typedef resolution works in semantic analysis
   - ‚ùå Parser can't use typedef names in declarations (classic C parsing issue)
   - Would require parser access to typedef table or lexer hack

## Implementation Roadmap (REVISED)

### Phase 1: Connect TypeEnvironment to Existing Symbol Tables ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Implementation Summary

Phase 1 has been successfully completed! The TypeEnvironment now properly connects to the existing symbol tables.

#### What Was Done

1. **Added getter methods to SemanticAnalyzer** (`into_type_info()`) to expose symbol_types and type_definitions
2. **Updated TypeEnvironment** from empty struct to hold actual type mappings
3. **Modified compilation pipeline** to pass type information from semantic analysis to typed AST conversion
4. **Updated all existing tests** to use the new API
5. **Created comprehensive test suite** with 13 tests covering various type scenarios

#### Key Discoveries During Implementation

##### The Typedef Parser Challenge

During implementation, we discovered a fundamental limitation: **typedef'd names cannot be used in variable declarations** because the parser doesn't have access to the typedef table.

Example that fails:

```c
typedef int myint;
myint x = 42;  // Parser error: expects ';' after 'myint'
```

The parser sees `myint` as an identifier (potential variable/function name), not a type specifier. This is a classic C parsing problem - you need semantic information during parsing to distinguish typedef names from other identifiers.

**Impact**: Typedefs are properly stored and can be resolved, but cannot yet be used in declarations. This would require either:

- Making typedef table available to the parser (complex)
- Using a lexer hack to mark typedef names as special tokens
- Two-pass parsing

##### What Works Now

- ‚úÖ Variable type lookups through symbol_types
- ‚úÖ Type information flows correctly from semantic analysis to typed AST
- ‚úÖ Typedef definitions are stored and accessible
- ‚úÖ All existing tests pass
- ‚úÖ 11 out of 13 new tests pass (2 document typedef limitation)

##### Files Modified

- `rcc-frontend/src/typed_ast/conversion.rs` - TypeEnvironment implementation
- `rcc-frontend/src/semantic/mod.rs` - Added getter methods
- `rcc-frontend/src/lib.rs` - Updated compilation pipeline
- `rcc-frontend/src/codegen/mod.rs` - Updated test calls
- `rcc-frontend/src/codegen_tests.rs` - Updated test calls
- `rcc-frontend/src/type_environment_tests.rs` - New comprehensive test suite

**Actual Time**: ~2 hours (even faster than estimated!)

### Phase 2: Cast Expression Support ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Why This Is Critical

- Required for void pointer usage (`(int*)void_ptr`)
- Needed for NULL implementation (`(void*)0`)
- Essential for type conversions
- Blocks test_pointers_evil.c at line 23

#### Implementation Status (Dec 2024) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

‚úÖ **Fully Implemented:**

- Parser support for cast expressions (`(type)expression` syntax)
- Type name parsing for abstract declarators
- Codegen for pointer-to-pointer casts (including void\*)
- Codegen for integer-to-pointer casts (with proper FatPointer creation, Unknown bank)
- Codegen for pointer-to-integer casts (extracts address from FatPointer)
- Codegen for integer-to-integer casts (pass-through for now, VM handles)
- Codegen for array-to-pointer decay
- NULL pointer support works correctly
- test_pointers_evil.c now progresses past line 23 (cast at line 23 works!)

**Test Results:**

- `test_cast_pointer.c` - ‚úÖ Passes (pointer casts)
- `test_cast_basic.c` - ‚úÖ Passes (all cast types including NULL)
- `test_pointers_evil.c` - Now fails at line 73 (complex declarator) instead of line 23

### Phase 3 Summary (Dec 2024) ‚úÖ CORE FEATURES COMPLETED

#### Completed Tasks:

1. **Struct Layout Calculation** ‚úÖ Fully implemented in `semantic/struct_layout.rs`

   - Handles field offsets and total size calculation
   - **Critical Fix**: Added `calculate_struct_layout_with_defs()` to resolve named struct references
   - Proper error handling for incomplete types, overflow, recursive structs
   - 9 comprehensive unit tests, all passing

2. **Member Access Parsing** ‚úÖ Already exists in `parser/expressions/postfix.rs`

   - Handles both `.` and `->` operators correctly
   - Supports chained member access (e.g., `obj.inner.field`)

3. **Type Definition Processing** ‚úÖ FIXED

   - Semantic analyzer properly processes struct type definitions
   - Typed AST conversion skips TypeDefinition items (no code generation needed)
   - Struct types available during compilation

4. **Member Access Implementation** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

   - Typed AST conversion converts Member to MemberAccess with correct offsets
   - IR generation uses GEP instructions (per POINTER_ARITHMETIC_ROADMAP.md)
   - Both rvalue and lvalue contexts supported

5. **Nested Struct Support** ‚úÖ FIXED

   - Resolved issue where nested struct fields had size 0
   - Properly calculates offsets for nested structures
   - Chained member access works correctly

6. **Testing** ‚úÖ EXPANDED
   - Added 8 new comprehensive struct tests
   - 7 struct tests passing
   - Test suite improved from 68/70 to 72/78 passing tests

#### Key Achievements:

‚úÖ **Core struct support is production-ready:**

- Basic struct definitions and member access
- Nested structures with proper size calculation
- Pointer to struct operations
- GEP-based field access ensuring correct bank handling
- Full compliance with POINTER_ARITHMETIC_ROADMAP.md requirements

‚ùå **Advanced features need future work:**

- Array fields in structs
- Pointer type assignments to struct fields
- Taking address of nested struct fields

#### Impact:

The compiler can now handle the majority of real-world struct usage patterns. The remaining issues are edge cases that don't block most C programs from compiling and running correctly.

#### Implementation Tasks

##### Task 2.1: Parser Support for Cast Expressions ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**File**: `rcc-frontend/src/parser/expressions/primary.rs`

‚úÖ Modified `parse_primary_expression()` to detect cast vs parenthesized expression:

```rust
Some(Token { token_type: TokenType::LeftParen, .. }) => {
    // Look ahead to determine if this is a cast or parenthesized expr
    if self.is_type_start() {
        // Parse cast expression
        let target_type = self.parse_type_name()?;
        self.expect(TokenType::RightParen, "cast expression")?;
        let operand = self.parse_unary_expression()?;
        ExpressionKind::Cast {
            target_type,
            operand: Box::new(operand),
        }
    } else {
        // Parse parenthesized expression
        let expr = self.parse_expression()?;
        self.expect(TokenType::RightParen, "parenthesized expression")?;
        return Ok(expr);
    }
}
```

##### Task 2.2: Type Name Parsing ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**File**: `rcc-frontend/src/parser/types.rs`

‚úÖ Added methods to parse type names in cast expressions:

```rust
pub fn parse_type_name(&mut self) -> Result<Type, CompilerError> {
    let base_type = self.parse_type_specifier()?;
    // Handle abstract declarators (*, [], etc. without identifier)
    self.parse_abstract_declarator(base_type)
}

pub fn is_type_start(&self) -> bool {
    matches!(self.peek().map(|t| &t.token_type), Some(
        TokenType::Void | TokenType::Char | TokenType::Int |
        TokenType::Short | TokenType::Long | TokenType::Unsigned |
        TokenType::Signed | TokenType::Struct | TokenType::Union |
        TokenType::Enum | TokenType::Identifier(_) // Could be typedef
    ))
}
```

##### Task 2.3: Codegen for Cast Expressions ‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

**File**: `rcc-frontend/src/codegen/expressions/mod.rs`

‚úÖ Implemented conservative codegen that returns errors for unimplemented cases:

```rust
TypedExpr::Cast { operand, target_type, .. } => {
    let operand_val = self.generate(operand)?;
    let source_type = operand.get_type();

    match (source_type, target_type) {
        // Pointer to pointer cast (including void*)
        (Type::Pointer { .. }, Type::Pointer { .. }) => {
            // Fat pointers: may need to adjust bank tag
            Ok(operand_val) // For now, just pass through
        }
        // Integer to pointer cast
        (t, Type::Pointer { .. }) if t.is_integer() => {
            // Convert integer to fat pointer
            self.builder.build_int_to_ptr(operand_val, target_type)
        }
        // Pointer to integer cast
        (Type::Pointer { .. }, t) if t.is_integer() => {
            // Extract address component from fat pointer
            self.builder.build_ptr_to_int(operand_val, target_type)
        }
        // Integer to integer cast
        (s, t) if s.is_integer() && t.is_integer() => {
            // Handle sign extension/truncation
            self.builder.build_int_cast(operand_val, source_type, target_type)
        }
        _ => Err(CodegenError::InvalidCast { source_type, target_type })
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Struct Support ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Dec 2024)

#### Why Structs Are Needed

- Required for struct field access via GEP (Phase 2.3 of pointer arithmetic)
- Common in real C code
- Need layout calculation for correct offsets

#### Implementation Status (Dec 2024) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

##### ‚úÖ All Core Tasks Completed:

##### Task 3.1: Struct Layout Calculation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**File**: `rcc-frontend/src/semantic/struct_layout.rs`

Fully implemented with:

- Field offset calculation
- Total size computation
- Recursive struct detection
- Comprehensive error handling for incomplete types, overflow, and circular references
- **Critical Enhancement**: Added `calculate_struct_layout_with_defs()` to resolve named struct references
- 9 passing unit tests covering all edge cases

##### Task 3.2: Member Access Parsing ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**File**: `rcc-frontend/src/parser/expressions/postfix.rs`

Member access parsing is already implemented and handles:

- Both `.` (direct member access) and `->` (pointer member access) operators
- Creates proper `Member` AST nodes with correct structure

##### Task 3.3: Type Definition Processing ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**File**: `rcc-frontend/src/semantic/mod.rs` and `rcc-frontend/src/typed_ast/conversion.rs`

- Semantic analyzer properly processes `TypeDefinition` items (line 64-72 of semantic/mod.rs)
- Type definitions are stored in the `type_definitions` HashMap
- Typed AST conversion now correctly skips TypeDefinition items (they don't generate code directly)
- **Fix applied**: Changed from returning error to continuing past TypeDefinition items

##### Task 3.4: Member Access Typed AST Conversion ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**File**: `rcc-frontend/src/typed_ast/conversion.rs` (line 353-412)

Successfully implemented conversion from `ExpressionKind::Member` to `TypedExpr::MemberAccess`:

- Looks up struct type from type environment
- Handles both `.` and `->` operators correctly
- Calculates field offset using struct layout module
- Passes offset information to codegen layer

##### Task 3.5: Member Access IR Generation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**File**: `rcc-frontend/src/codegen/expressions/mod.rs` (line 201-242)

Successfully implemented GEP-based struct field access:

- Generates GEP instructions as required by POINTER_ARITHMETIC_ROADMAP.md
- Handles bank overflow correctly through `build_pointer_offset`
- Properly loads values from calculated field addresses
- Works for both rvalue and lvalue contexts

##### Task 3.6: Lvalue Member Access ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**File**: `rcc-frontend/src/codegen/expressions/unary_ops.rs` (line 214-242)

Added support for member access in lvalue contexts (assignments):

- Handles `p.x = value` and `ptr->y = value` correctly
- Uses GEP to calculate field addresses
- Enables struct field modifications

##### Task 3.7: Nested Struct Size Resolution ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Critical Fix)

**Issue Fixed**: Named struct references (e.g., `struct Inner inner;`) had size 0
**Solution**: Enhanced layout calculation to resolve named struct types through type_definitions

##### Test Results:

**Passing Tests (7 total):**

- `test_struct_simple.c` ‚úÖ Basic struct member access
- `test_struct_basic.c` ‚úÖ Various struct operations
- `test_struct_inline.c` ‚úÖ Inline struct definitions
- `test_struct_nested.c` ‚úÖ Nested struct with chained member access
- `test_struct_nested_minimal.c` ‚úÖ Minimal nested struct test
- `test_struct_offset_debug.c` ‚úÖ Struct field offset verification
- `test_struct_basic_pointer.c` ‚úÖ Pointer to struct operations

**Overall Progress**: 72 out of 78 tests passing (improved from 68/70)

### Phase 3.5: Advanced Struct Features - ‚úÖ COMPLETED (January 2025)

#### All Major Struct Issues Resolved!

##### Issue 1: Array Fields in Structs

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED (January 2025)
**Affected Tests**:

- `test_struct_array_fields.c` - ‚úÖ Now passing
- `test_struct_offsets.c` - ‚úÖ Now passing

**Solution**: Modified member access code generation to return address for array fields

- Arrays now properly decay to pointers when accessed as struct members
- Array indexing on struct fields works correctly
  **Example**:

```c
struct Buffer {
    int data[5];
};
struct Buffer buf;
buf.data[0] = 10;  // Now works correctly!
```

##### Issue 2: Pointer Type Assignment to Struct Fields

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED (January 2025)
**Affected Tests**:

- `test_struct_pointer_members.c` - ‚úÖ Now passing

**Solution**: Fixed member type resolution in `ExpressionAnalyzer::analyze()`

- Member access properly resolves field types through `TypeAnalyzer::resolve_type()`
- Nested struct field types are correctly resolved
  **Example**:

```c
struct Node {
    int* ptr;
};
struct Node n;
n.ptr = &data;  // Works correctly!
```

##### Issue 3: Taking Address of Nested Struct Field

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED (January 2025)
**Affected Tests**:

- `test_struct_nested_address.c` - ‚úÖ Now passing (new test added)

**Solution**: Fixed struct field type resolution in semantic analysis

- Struct field types are now resolved when registering type definitions
- Nested struct fields have their full type information available
- Size calculations work correctly for nested structs
  **Example**:

```c
struct Outer {
    struct Inner inner;
};
struct Outer obj;
struct Inner* ptr = &obj.inner;  // Now works correctly!
```

#### Remaining Edge Cases

Only one struct test still fails (`test_struct_evil.c`) due to a complex combination of features, but all core struct functionality is working.

### Phase 4: Typedef Support

#### Why Typedef Is Important

- Required for type aliases
- Common in C code (size_t, FILE, etc.)
- Needed for clean type resolution

#### Implementation Tasks

##### Task 4.1: Typedef Registration

During semantic analysis, register typedefs in symbol table.

##### Task 4.2: Typedef Resolution

When encountering an identifier in type position, check if it's a typedef.

##### Task 4.3: Update Parser

Parser needs to distinguish typedef names from regular identifiers.

### Phase 5: NULL Support

#### Implementation Approach

1. Define NULL as a macro or builtin: `#define NULL ((void*)0)`
2. Or recognize literal 0 in pointer context as NULL
3. Ensure void\* cast works (requires Phase 2)

## Testing Strategy

### Test Order

1. **Symbol table tests** - Variable type lookups
2. **Cast expression tests** - Type conversions
3. **Struct tests** - Member access and layout
4. **Typedef tests** - Type aliases
5. **Integration tests** - Combined features

### Key Test Files to Enable

- `test_pointers_evil.c` - Requires casts, void pointers
- Future pointer arithmetic tests from POINTER_ARITHMETIC_ROADMAP.md

## Implementation Order (REVISED)

### Recommended Sequence

1. **Phase 1**: Connect TypeEnvironment (1-2 days!)

   - Just wire existing symbol_types to TypeEnvironment
   - Immediately unblocks type lookups
   - Typedef support already works!

2. **Phase 2**: Cast Expressions (3-4 days)

   - Parser changes to recognize cast syntax
   - Codegen implementation for type conversions
   - Makes test_pointers_evil.c progress further

3. **Phase 3**: Struct Support (1 week)

   - Struct layout calculation
   - Complete member access parsing
   - Required for GEP field access

4. **Phase 4**: NULL Support (1 day)
   - Simple once casts work
   - Define as `(void*)0` or recognize 0 in pointer context

**Total Estimate**: ~2 weeks (reduced from 3 weeks!)

### Major Discovery

- **Typedef support already exists** in semantic analysis - just needs to be passed through!
- **Symbol type tracking is complete** - just disconnected from typed AST layer
- Phase 1 is now a simple wiring task instead of building from scratch

## Success Criteria

### Must Have

- ‚úÖ Symbol table tracks all variable types
- ‚úÖ Cast expressions parse and generate correct code
- ‚úÖ Struct member access works with correct offsets
- ‚úÖ Typedef names resolve correctly
- ‚úÖ test_pointers_evil.c compiles and runs

### Should Have

- ‚úÖ NULL recognized as `(void*)0`
- ‚úÖ Proper error messages for type mismatches
- ‚úÖ Support for anonymous structs
- ‚úÖ Nested struct support

### Nice to Have

- Union support
- Enum support beyond basic integers
- Better typedef scoping rules
- Type qualifiers (const, volatile)

## Relationship to Pointer Arithmetic

Once these prerequisites are complete, the pointer arithmetic implementation can proceed because:

1. **Type lookups work** - Can determine if expression is pointer
2. **Casts work** - Can handle void\* and type conversions
3. **Structs work** - Can generate GEP for field access
4. **Full type info available** - Can properly scale pointer arithmetic

This forms the foundation that POINTER_ARITHMETIC_ROADMAP.md assumes exists.

## Current Status (January 2025)

### ‚úÖ Completed Phases

1. **Phase 1: TypeEnvironment Connection** - Symbol types flow correctly
2. **Phase 2: Cast Expression Support** - All cast types working
3. **Phase 3: Core Struct Support** - ‚úÖ FULLY COMPLETED
   - Basic struct definitions and member access
   - Nested structures with proper size calculation
   - Pointer to struct operations
   - Array fields in structs
   - Taking address of nested struct fields
   - GEP-based field access ensuring correct bank handling
4. **Architectural Cleanup** - Unified type checking system
5. **Code Modularization** - Split large `expressions.rs` (670 lines) into focused modules:
   - `expressions/analyzer.rs` - Main expression analyzer (284 lines)
   - `expressions/binary.rs` - Binary operations and pointer arithmetic (255 lines)
   - `expressions/unary.rs` - Unary operations and address-of logic (119 lines)
   - `expressions/initializers.rs` - Initializer and compound literal analysis (68 lines)

### üöß In Progress

- **Phase 4: Typedef Support** - Parser integration needed

### üìä Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: 76/79 tests passing (96.2%)
- **Struct Tests**: 11/12 passing (91.7% - all core features working!)
- **Ready for**: Production use with structs including complex nested patterns
- **Architecture**: Clean, single source of truth for type checking

## Architectural Improvements (January 2025)

### Unified Type Checking System

We eliminated the dual type checking architecture that was causing inconsistencies:

**Before**:

- `ExpressionAnalyzer` (single large file) in semantic phase did partial type checking
- `TypeChecker` module re-checked types during typed AST conversion
- Duplicate logic, potential inconsistencies, incomplete coverage

**After**:

- All type checking happens in modularized `ExpressionAnalyzer` during semantic analysis
  - Main analyzer in `semantic/expressions/analyzer.rs`
  - Binary operations in `semantic/expressions/binary.rs`
  - Unary operations in `semantic/expressions/unary.rs`
  - Initializers in `semantic/expressions/initializers.rs`
- Typed AST conversion trusts `expr.expr_type` from semantic analysis
- `TypeChecker` module completely removed
- Single source of truth for types

### Key Benefits

1. **Consistency**: One place for type rules
2. **Maintainability**: No duplicate code to keep in sync
3. **Completeness**: All expressions get proper type checking
4. **Performance**: No redundant type checking

### Implementation Details

- Moved pointer arithmetic logic from `TypeChecker` to modularized `ExpressionAnalyzer`
  - Binary operations (including pointer arithmetic) in `semantic/expressions/binary.rs`
  - Unary operations (address-of, dereference) in `semantic/expressions/unary.rs`
- Enhanced `TypeAnalyzer::resolve_type()` with exhaustive matching
- Improved error handling with proper `SemanticError` types
- Fixed member type resolution for nested structs in `semantic/expressions/analyzer.rs`

## Conclusion

The type system prerequisites are **fully complete** for production use. The compiler now has:

- ‚úÖ Full symbol table integration with type tracking
- ‚úÖ Complete cast expression support (all cast types working)
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready struct support** including:
  - Nested structures with correct size calculation
  - Array fields in structs
  - Taking address of nested struct fields
  - Pointer to struct operations
  - GEP-based field access with bank overflow handling
- ‚úÖ Clean, unified type checking architecture
- ‚úÖ Proper type resolution in semantic analysis phase

**Current State**: The compiler successfully handles 96.2% of all tests (76/79 passing), with struct support at 91.7% (11/12 passing). All fundamental type system features required for the pointer arithmetic roadmap are implemented and working.

**Key Implementation Insight**: The critical fix was to resolve struct field types during semantic analysis (when registering type definitions) rather than trying to resolve them during code generation. This ensures all types are fully resolved before reaching the typed AST phase.

**Next Steps**:

1. ‚úÖ Ready to proceed with POINTER_ARITHMETIC_ROADMAP.md implementation
2. Implement typedef support for better C compatibility (optional enhancement)
3. Address remaining edge cases in `test_struct_evil.c` (low priority)

# V2 Backend Architecture Documentation

## Project Overview

This is the Ripple C Compiler (RCC) backend, part of a larger toolchain that compiles C code to run on the Ripple VM - a custom 16-bit virtual machine. The compilation pipeline is:

```
C Code ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí IR ‚Üí V2 Backend ‚Üí Ripple Assembly ‚Üí Assembler ‚Üí Binary
```

## System Architecture

### The Ripple VM

The Ripple VM is a 16-bit virtual machine with:

- **Memory banks**: Memory is divided into banks of 4096 instructions (16384 cells)
- **18 registers**: Including special-purpose registers for banks
- **Stack-based architecture**: Uses a stack for local variables and function calls
- **Fat pointers**: Pointers are 32-bit (16-bit address + 16-bit bank)

### Why Banks?

The 16-bit architecture can only address 64K cells directly. Banks extend this:

- Each bank contains 4096 instructions
- Bank 0: Global data (.data, .rodata)
- Bank 1: Stack
- Bank 2+: Future heap/dynamic allocation

This allows programs larger than 64K while maintaining 16-bit efficiency.

## The V1 ‚Üí V2 Rewrite

### What Went Wrong in V1?

V1 had fundamental ABI violations that made it completely non-functional:

1. **Stack Bank Never Initialized**

   - R13 (stack bank register) was never set to 1
   - ALL stack operations used random memory
   - Programs would corrupt random memory instead of using stack

2. **Calling Convention Violations**

   - Used R3-R8 for parameters
   - But R3-R4 are reserved for return values!
   - This caused parameter/return value collisions

3. **Incomplete Pointer Returns**

   - Only returned address in R3
   - Forgot to return bank in R4
   - Made all returned pointers unusable

4. **Bank Register Confusion**
   - Mixed up when to use R0 (global) vs R13 (stack)
   - Loaded/stored from wrong memory regions

### V2 Design Principles

1. **Correctness First**: Follow specifications exactly
2. **Test-Driven**: Every feature has tests
3. **Clear Separation**: Implementation split into focused modules

### Module Responsibilities

#### `regalloc.rs` - Register Allocator

- Manages R5-R11 (7 general-purpose registers)
- Spills to stack when out of registers
- Tracks pointer bank information
- **CRITICAL**: Initializes R13=1 for stack access

#### `function.rs` - Function Lowering

- Generates prologue (function entry)
- Generates epilogue (function exit)
- Manages local variables
- Handles return values

#### `calling_convention.rs` - Calling Convention

- Stack-based parameter passing
- Return value handling (R3 for scalar, R3+R4 for pointers)
- Cross-bank function calls
- Stack cleanup after calls

## Key Algorithms

### Register Allocation

Uses a simple spill-based allocator:

1. Maintain free list of R5-R11
2. When register needed:
   - If free register available ‚Üí use it
   - Else ‚Üí spill least-recently-used register to stack
3. Track spilled values for reload
4. Pin registers during critical sections

### Stack Frame Management

```
Growing ‚Üì
+------------------+
| Caller's frame   |
+==================+ ‚Üê FP (Frame Pointer)
| Local variables  | FP+0, FP+1, ...
+------------------+
| Spill slots      | FP+L, FP+L+1, ...
+------------------+ ‚Üê SP (Stack Pointer)
| (Next frame)     |
+------------------+

Parameters at: FP-3, FP-4, FP-5, ...
```

### Cross-Bank Calls

For calling functions in different banks:

1. Set PCB (Program Counter Bank) to target bank
2. JAL (Jump And Link) to target address
3. JAL automatically saves return bank in RAB
4. On return, restore PCB from RAB

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage (23 tests)

- **Register Allocation** (9 tests)

  - R13 initialization
  - Register allocation order
  - Spilling and reloading
  - Parameter loading
  - Pinning mechanism

- **Function Generation** (6 tests)

  - Prologue with R13 init
  - Epilogue with bank restore
  - Scalar returns
  - Fat pointer returns
  - Local variable access

- **Calling Convention** (8 tests)
  - Stack-based arguments
  - Fat pointer arguments
  - Stack cleanup
  - Return value handling
  - Cross-bank calls

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all V2 tests
cargo test --package rcc-ir --lib v2::tests::

# Run specific module tests
cargo test --package rcc-ir --lib v2::tests::regalloc_tests::
cargo test --package rcc-ir --lib v2::tests::function_tests::
cargo test --package rcc-ir --lib v2::tests::calling_convention_tests::
```

## Integration Points

### Input: IR (Intermediate Representation)

The V2 backend receives IR instructions like:

- `Alloca` - Allocate local variable
- `Store` - Store to memory
- `Load` - Load from memory
- `Call` - Function call
- `Ret` - Return from function
- `GetElementPtr` - Pointer arithmetic

### Output: Assembly Instructions

Generates Ripple VM assembly:

- `LI R13, 1` - Load immediate
- `STORE Rs, Rb, Ra` - Store Rs to memory[Rb][Ra]
- `LOAD Rd, Rb, Ra` - Load from memory[Rb][Ra]
- `JAL addr` - Jump and link
- `JALR Rd, 0, Rs` - Jump and link register
- `ADD/SUB/MUL/DIV` - Arithmetic
- etc.

### External Dependencies

- `rcc-codegen`: Defines `AsmInst` enum and `Reg` enum
- `ripple-asm`: The assembler that converts assembly to binary
- `rvm`: The virtual machine that executes the binary

## Future Work

### Immediate TODOs

1. **Memory Operations**

   - Implement Load/Store instruction generation
   - Ensure correct bank usage

2. **GEP (GetElementPtr)**

   - Implement bank-aware pointer arithmetic
   - Handle bank overflow correctly

3. **IR Integration**
   - Connect V2 backend to IR lowering
   - Replace V1 usage

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Optimization**

   - Better register allocation (graph coloring?)
   - Peephole optimizations
   - Dead code elimination

2. **Debugging Support**

   - Source location tracking
   - Better error messages
   - Debug symbol generation

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Inline assembly support
   - SIMD operations (if VM supports)
   - Link-time optimization

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Symptom                    | Likely Cause           | Solution                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Random crashes             | R13 not initialized    | Add `LI R13, 1` at function start   |
| Wrong values               | Using R3-R4 for params | Use stack for parameters            |
| Can't return from function | PCB not restored       | Add `ADD PCB, RAB, R0` before JALR  |
| Memory corruption          | Wrong bank register    | Use R0 for global, R13 for stack    |
| Spill/reload fails         | R13 not initialized    | Initialize R13 before any stack ops |

## Practical RISC Instruction Set (32 instructions)

### The Instructions

| Opcode   | Mnemonic       | Format | Description              |
| -------- | -------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| **0x00** | NOP            | R      | No operation             |
| **0x01** | ADD rd,rs,rt   | R      | rd = rs + rt             |
| **0x02** | SUB rd,rs,rt   | R      | rd = rs - rt             |
| **0x03** | AND rd,rs,rt   | R      | rd = rs & rt             |
| **0x04** | OR rd,rs,rt    | R      | rd = rs \| rt            |
| **0x05** | XOR rd,rs,rt   | R      | rd = rs ^ rt             |
| **0x06** | SLL rd,rs,rt   | R      | rd = rs << (rt & 15)     |
| **0x07** | SRL rd,rs,rt   | R      | rd = rs >> (rt & 15)     |
| **0x08** | SLT rd,rs,rt   | R      | rd = (rs < rt) ? 1 : 0   |
| **0x09** | SLTU rd,rs,rt  | R      | rd = unsigned compare    |
|          |                |        |                          |
| **0x10** | ADDI rd,rs,imm | I      | rd = rs + sign_ext(imm)  |
| **0x11** | ANDI rd,rs,imm | I      | rd = rs & zero_ext(imm)  |
| **0x12** | ORI rd,rs,imm  | I      | rd = rs \| zero_ext(imm) |
| **0x13** | ORI rd,rs,imm  | I      | rd = rs \| zero_ext(imm) |
| **0x14** | LI rd,imm      | I      | rd = imm << 10           |
| **0x15** | SLLI rd,rs,imm | I      | rd = rs << imm           |
| **0x16** | SRLI rd,rs,imm | I      | rd = rs >> imm           |

| **0x17** | GETPC rd | I | rd = PC |
| | | | |
| **0x20** | LOAD rd,rs,rt | I | rd = mem[rsbank][rt] |
| **0x21** | STORE rd,rs,rt | I | mem[rs + imm] = rd |

| **0x30** | BEQ rs,rt,imm | I | if(rs==rt) PC += imm |
| **0x31** | BNE rs,rt,imm | I | if(rs!=rt) PC += imm |
| **0x32** | BLT rs,rt,imm | I | if(rs<rt) PC += imm |
| **0x33** | BGE rs,rt,imm | I | if(rs>=rt) PC += imm |
| | | | |
| **0x38** | J addr | J | PC = addr |
| **0x39** | JAL addr | J | R7 = PC+1; PC = addr |
| **0x3A** | JR rs | R | PC = rs |
| **0x3B** | JALR rd,rs | R | rd = PC+1; PC = rs |
| | | | |
| **0x3E** | TRAP imm | J | System call |
| **0x3F** | HALT | J | Stop execution |

### Registers (Clean AF)

| Register  | Purpose                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| **R0**    | Always zero (hardwired)           |
| **R1-R6** | General purpose                   |
| **R7**    | Link register (return address)    |
| **SP**    | Stack pointer (separate register) |
| **PC**    | Program counter                   |

### Why This Doesn't Suck

1. **Predictable timing** - Every instruction takes known cycles
2. **No modes** - Instruction does ONE thing
3. **Orthogonal** - Any register can be used anywhere
4. **Simple pipeline** - Fetch/Decode/Execute/Memory/Writeback
5. **R0 = 0** - Free zero constant, makes so much shit easier

### Example: Multiply by 10

```asm
    ; R2 = R1 * 10
    SLLI R2, R1, 3    ; R2 = R1 * 8
    SLLI R3, R1, 1    ; R3 = R1 * 2
    ADD  R2, R2, R3   ; R2 = R1*8 + R1*2
```

Clean, predictable, no weird addressing mode fuckery. This is what a sane person would implement in Brainfuck üòÇ

Hell yeah! Let me build you the complete reference table with all the juicy details.

## Complete RISC Instruction Reference

### Architecture Overview

- **NO FLAGS REGISTER** - This is pure RISC philosophy
- Comparisons set a register to 1 or 0 instead of flags
- Branches compare registers directly
- Simpler hardware, easier to pipeline, less state to track

# Mastering the Debugger & Execution Environment

## Welcome to Visual Debugging

Remember the last time you tried to debug a Brainfuck program? Staring at a wall of brackets and symbols, mentally tracking which cell you're on, what value it holds, and wondering why your output is completely wrong? Those days are over.

This debugger transforms Brainfuck from a black box into a glass box. You can see everything: every cell, every pointer movement, every value change. It's like having X-ray vision for your code. Let me show you how to use these superpowers.

## The Art of Execution: Five Ways to Run Your Code

Think of the execution modes like gears in a car. Sometimes you need first gear to carefully navigate a tricky section, and sometimes you want fifth gear to cruise down the highway. The IDE gives you five distinct ways to run your programs, each optimized for different scenarios.

### Step Mode: The Microscope

When you're learning Brainfuck or debugging a particularly nasty bug, Step Mode is your best friend. Each press of the step button executes exactly one instruction. You see the pointer move. You see the value change. You understand exactly what `[->+<]` does because you watch it happen, step by step.

This is how I recommend everyone starts with Brainfuck. Write a simple program, maybe just `+++.`, and step through it. Watch cell 0 go from 0 to 1 to 2 to 3. Watch the dot command output the ASCII character for 3 (which is a non-printable character, but you get the idea). This builds intuition that's impossible to get any other way.

### Smooth Mode: The Balanced Approach

Once you understand the basics, Smooth Mode becomes your daily driver. It runs your program at a comfortable pace ‚Äì fast enough to be practical, slow enough to follow along. The tape updates smoothly, output appears in real-time, and all your breakpoints are respected.

Think of it like watching a movie of your program executing. You can see the pointer sliding across the tape, values incrementing and decrementing, loops spinning. If something goes wrong, you'll see it happen. This mode strikes the perfect balance between speed and visibility.

### Turbo Mode: When You Need Speed

You've debugged your program, you know it works, and now you just need it to run. Turbo Mode throws visualization out the window in favor of raw speed. The display updates infrequently, maybe every thousand operations or so. Your program runs almost as fast as native Brainfuck.

This is perfect for those computation-heavy programs ‚Äì calculating Fibonacci numbers, generating fractals, or running any algorithm that involves millions of operations. You still get the safety of the IDE (infinite loop detection, memory bounds checking), but without the performance penalty of constant visualization.

### Custom Delay Mode: You're in Control

Sometimes you need something specific. Maybe you're teaching Brainfuck to a class and want a 200ms delay so students can follow along. Maybe you're creating a video and need consistent timing. Or maybe you're debugging a specific section and want it to run at exactly the speed that helps you understand it.

Custom Delay Mode puts you in the driver's seat. Set any delay from 0 to 1000 milliseconds. The setting persists between sessions, so once you find your sweet spot, it's always there waiting for you.

### Rust WASM Mode: Maximum Overdrive

This is where things get serious. Your Brainfuck code is compiled to WebAssembly and runs at near-native speed. We're talking millions of operations per second. That Mandelbrot set generator that takes minutes in regular mode? It finishes in seconds.

The trade-off is that you lose debugging features ‚Äì no stepping, no breakpoints, no tape visualization during execution. But when you need speed, when you need to run that complex algorithm or process large amounts of data, this mode delivers performance that rivals compiled C code.

## The Memory Tape: Three Ways to See Your Data

The memory tape is the heart of Brainfuck ‚Äì it's where all your data lives. But not all data is the same. Sometimes you're working with strings, sometimes with numbers, sometimes with complex data structures. That's why we offer three different visualization modes.

### Normal View: The Classic

This is your standard, everyday view. Each cell is displayed with its decimal value, and when that value represents a printable ASCII character, you see that too. Cell 65 shows "65 (A)", cell 10 shows "10 (\n)". The current pointer position is highlighted in blue, making it impossible to lose track of where you are.

This view is perfect for most Brainfuck programming. It gives you all the information you need without overwhelming you. You can see enough cells to understand context, but each cell is large enough to read comfortably.

### Compact View: The Overview

When your program uses hundreds or thousands of cells, Normal View becomes impractical. You'd spend all your time scrolling. Compact View solves this by shrinking the display, fitting many more cells on screen at once.

Think of it like zooming out on a map. You lose some detail ‚Äì maybe you can't see the ASCII representations ‚Äì but you gain perspective. You can see patterns in your data, identify which regions of memory are being used, spot that one cell that's different from all the others.

### Lane View: The Game Changer

This is where the debugger gets really innovative. Lane View arranges your memory tape into multiple columns, transforming your linear tape into a 2D grid. Set it to 8 lanes, and suddenly cells 0-7 are the first row, 8-15 are the second row, and so on.

Why is this revolutionary? Because suddenly, complex data structures become visible. That sorting algorithm you're implementing? Watch the values bubble up through the grid. Working with a virtual 2D array? See it as an actual 2D array. Processing image data? View it in a format that actually makes sense.

You can even label the lanes. Working with a record structure where every 4 cells represent a person (age, height, weight, ID)? Label the lanes accordingly and never get confused about which cell holds what.

## Navigation: Getting Around Your Memory

With potentially thousands of cells to work with, navigation becomes crucial. We provide several ways to jump around the tape quickly and precisely.

### The Basics

**Go to Start** instantly jumps to cell 0. Lost in the wilderness of cell 2847? One click brings you home.

**Go to Pointer** centers the view on wherever your pointer currently is. This is incredibly useful during debugging ‚Äì your pointer might be at cell 500 while you're looking at cell 100.

**Go to End** jumps to the highest cell that's been modified. This helps you understand your program's memory footprint.

### Go to Cell: The Power Tool

But here's where it gets interesting. Click "Go to Cell" and you can type not just a cell number, but a mathematical expression. Need to check cell 256? Type `256`. But what if you want to check the cell at the end of a 16x16 grid? Type `16 * 16 - 1`. Want to see what's 10 cells after the middle of a 100-cell buffer? Type `50 + 10`.

This feature understands that when you're debugging, you're often thinking in terms of calculations and offsets. Instead of doing mental math and typing `127`, you can type `128 - 1` and keep your mental context intact.

## Breakpoints: Pause Where It Matters

Breakpoints are like bookmarks for debugging. They tell the debugger "when you get here, stop and let me look around." They're essential for understanding program flow and catching bugs.

### Setting Breakpoints

The easiest way is to click on any line number in the editor. A red dot appears ‚Äì you've just set a breakpoint. When your program reaches that line, execution pauses. You can set as many as you want, creating a debugging journey through your code.

But breakpoints can be smarter than just "stop here." You can create conditional breakpoints that only trigger when certain conditions are met. Debugging a loop that runs 1000 times but only fails on iteration 999? Set a conditional breakpoint that only triggers when a counter cell equals 999.

Or you can just use the `$` symbol anywhere in the code ‚Äî IDE will automatically break there. This is great for quick debugging without cluttering your code with manual breakpoints.

## The Output Panel: More Than Just Text

The output panel might seem simple ‚Äì it's where your program's output goes ‚Äì but it's surprisingly sophisticated.

### Beyond Simple Output

When you enable the Assembly workspace, the output panel becomes even more powerful. You get additional tabs:

**VM Output** can be set up to show the memory-mapped output of the VM.

**Disassembly View** shows the actual machine instructions being executed. Yep, it disassembles Brainfuck tape.

## Tips from the Trenches

After years of debugging Brainfuck, here are my hard-won insights:

**Start with Step Mode**: I don't care how confident you are. Step through your program at least once. You'll be surprised what you learn.

**Label Everything**: Use the Marks feature liberally. Every important cell should have a name. Your future self will thank you.

**Save Snapshots Before Experiments**: About to try something risky? Snapshot first. It's like quicksave in a video game.

**Use Lane View for Algorithms**: Implementing quicksort? Use lane view. Working with matrices? Lane view. Any time you have structured data, lane view makes it visible.

**Profile Before Optimizing**: Don't guess what's slow. Run the profiler and know what's slow. Optimize the right thing.

## Your Debugging Journey

The debugger transforms Brainfuck from an exercise in frustration into a genuinely enjoyable puzzle. Every bug becomes a solvable mystery. Every optimization opportunity becomes visible. Every program becomes understandable.

Start with simple programs and use Step Mode to build intuition. Graduate to Smooth Mode for general development. Master breakpoints for efficient debugging. Explore Lane View for complex data structures. Push the limits with Turbo and WASM modes.

Remember: in traditional Brainfuck, you're blindfolded in a dark room. With this debugger, you have night vision goggles and a map. Use them wisely, and there's no bug you can't squash, no program you can't understand, no algorithm you can't implement.

Happy debugging, and may your pointers always point where you expect them to!

# The Editor System: Your Creative Workspace

## Where Code Comes to Life

Welcome to the heart of the IDE ‚Äì the editor system. If you've ever used VS Code, Sublime, or any modern editor, you'll feel right at home. If you haven't, don't worry ‚Äì I'll walk you through everything. This isn't just a text editor; it's a sophisticated development environment that understands Brainfuck at a fundamental level and helps you write better code faster.

## The Three Editors: Each with a Purpose

The IDE actually gives you three different editors, each specialized for its own task. Think of them like different tools in a workshop ‚Äì you wouldn't use a hammer to paint, and you wouldn't use a paintbrush to drive nails.

### The Main Editor: Where the Magic Happens

This is your primary workspace, where Brainfuck code lives and breathes. Open the IDE and you'll see it front and center, ready for action. Type a simple `+` and watch it light up ‚Äì the editor immediately recognizes it as a value modification command. Type `>` and it turns orange, showing pointer movement. Already, the editor is working with you, not just for you.

But here's what makes it special: this editor is deeply integrated with the debugger. Set a breakpoint by clicking a line number, and a red dot appears. Run your program, and watch as a green rectangle follows your execution, symbol by symbol. It's like having a reading guide that shows you exactly where the computer is in your code.

### The Macro Editor: Your Power Tool

Hidden by default (look for the "Show Macro Editor" button), the Macro Editor is where you escape the constraints of raw Brainfuck. This is where you define your own language on top of Brainfuck.

Let me show you what I mean. Copy this code into the Macro Editor:

```brainfuck
#define clear [-]
#define inc(n) {repeat(n, +)}
#define set(n) @clear @inc(n)

#define HELLO {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'}

#define hello {
  {for(c in #HELLO, @set(c) .)}
}

@hello // invoke the macro
```

Neat, right?

### The Assembly Editor: For the Adventurous

When you enable the Assembly workspace in settings, a third editor appears. This one speaks a different language entirely ‚Äì Ripple VM assembly. If you're curious about how computers really work at the lowest level, this editor lets you write code that's just one step above machine code.

It has its own syntax highlighting for instructions like `LI` (load immediate), `ADD`, `JMP` (jump), and more. It understands labels, so you can write `loop:` and later jump to it. It even has a data section where you can define strings and constants. This isn't just a Brainfuck IDE anymore ‚Äì it's a complete low-level development environment. Still compiles to Brainfuck.

## Search: Finding Your Way

Press Cmd/Ctrl+F and watch the search bar slide down from the top of the editor. This isn't your grandmother's search function. Start typing and matches light up instantly across your code. The current match glows bright yellow while others are dimmed, and a counter shows "2 of 15 matches" so you always know where you are.

But here's where it gets powerful: click the regex button and now you can search with regular expressions. Want to find all loops that start with a plus? Search for `\[\+`. Want to find all places where you move right and then increment? Search for `>\+`.

The search is also smart about context. It knows about comments and can optionally ignore them. It can do whole-word matching, so searching for "add" won't match "address". And it remembers your last search, so pressing F3 instantly repeats it.

## Jump to definition and find references: The Power of Macros

Press Cmd/Ctrl+click on any macro name, and the editor jumps to its definition in the Macro Editor. This is incredibly useful when you're deep in a complex macro and need to see how it works.

Press it on a macro definition, and it shows you all places where that macro is invoked in your code. This is like having a superpower ‚Äì you can see how your macros are used without manually searching for them.

## Refactoring: Changing Code with Confidence

Shift+click on any macro name, and safely rename every occurrence in your code. No more manual find-and-replace that breaks things. The editor understands the context of your macros and updates them everywhere they appear.

## Quick Navigation: Teleportation for Your Code

Press Cmd/Ctrl+P and something magical happens ‚Äì the Quick Navigation panel appears. This is your teleporter, your way to instantly jump anywhere in your code.

Start typing "set" and it shows you all macros with "set" in the name. Click on `set_value` and boom ‚Äì you're there. But it's not just for macros. Add special comments like `// MARK: Main Loop` and they appear in Quick Nav too. Now you can organize your code into logical sections and jump between them instantly.

In a 500-line program, this is the difference between scrolling for 30 seconds and jumping instantly. It's the difference between losing your train of thought and maintaining your flow. Once you start using Quick Nav, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.

## The Minimap: Your Code from 30,000 Feet

Look to the right side of the editor (if it's enabled) and you'll see a tiny version of your entire file ‚Äì the minimap. This isn't just a scaled-down copy; it's a navigation tool. The highlighted rectangle shows what's currently visible in your main editor. Click anywhere in the minimap to jump there instantly. Drag the rectangle to scroll smoothly through your code.

The minimap is especially useful for long programs. You can see the overall structure ‚Äì dense sections of code, sparse sections with lots of comments, loops nested within loops. It's like having a map of your program's geography. Pattern recognition kicks in, and you start navigating by the shape of your code rather than reading it.

## Bracket Matching: Never Lose Your Place

In Brainfuck, brackets are everything. One mismatched bracket and your program is broken. The editor has your back. Put your cursor on any `[` and its matching `]` lights up. Put it on a `]` and its `[` appears. If a bracket doesn't have a match, it does not highlight.

## Auto-Expansion: Real-Time Macro Magic

When you're working with macros, enable Auto-Expand and watch the magic happen. Every time you save or modify the Macro Editor, your macros are instantly expanded in the Main Editor. It's like having a compiler that runs constantly in the background.

Write a macro, see the Brainfuck. Fix an error, see the correction immediately. This tight feedback loop makes macro development incredibly fast. You're not guessing what your macro will produce ‚Äì you're seeing it in real-time.

If there's an error, it appears as a red banner at the top of the editor: "Undefined macro 'test' on line 5". Click the error and it jumps to line 5. Fix it, and the error disappears. It's like having a helpful assistant constantly checking your work.

## Split View: See Everything at Once

The Macro Editor and Main Editor can be visible simultaneously, side by side. Write a macro on the left, see its expansion on the right. Adjust the divider to give more space to whichever you're focusing on. Double-click the divider to reset to 50/50.

This split view is especially powerful when debugging macros. You can see exactly which macro code corresponds to which Brainfuck output. When an error occurs in the expanded code, you can trace it back to the exact macro that generated it.

## Tips from a Power User

After hours of using this editor, here are the techniques that make the biggest difference:

**Use MARK Comments Liberally**: Sprinkle `// MARK: Section Name` comments throughout your code. They become waypoints in Quick Nav, making navigation instant.

**Trust Auto-Expand**: When writing macros, let Auto-Expand run. The immediate feedback catches errors before they become problems.

# Welcome to the Braintease IDE

## Your Gateway to Esoteric Programming

Welcome to the most advanced Brainfuck development environment ever created! Whether you're a curious beginner exploring the minimalist beauty of Brainfuck, or an experienced developer pushing the boundaries of what's possible with eight simple commands, this IDE transforms the traditionally challenging experience of Brainfuck programming into something approachable and even enjoyable.

And yes, these tutorials were written by AI ‚Äî I would absolutely die writing all this by hand. After all, I wrote the custom fucking editor and the whole VM in Brainfuck macro, so I deserve a break, right? However, I will leave some comments here and there. I needed to read all this to make sure it makes sense, so I might as well leave some comments for you, the reader.

## What Makes This IDE Special?

Imagine trying to write a novel using only eight letters of the alphabet. That's essentially what programming in Brainfuck is like. This IDE doesn't change the language itself, but it gives you powerful tools to understand, visualize, and debug your code in ways that were previously impossible.

The IDE brings together three major innovations: a visual debugger that shows you exactly what's happening in memory as your program runs, a sophisticated macro system that lets you write reusable code patterns, and even an assembly language workspace for those ready to dive into low-level virtual machine programming.

## Getting Started: The Editor System

When you first open the IDE, you'll see the main editor ‚Äì your primary workspace. This isn't just a text editor; it's an intelligent environment that understands Brainfuck at a deep level. As you type, the syntax highlighting helps you distinguish between different types of operations: pointer movements appear in yellow, value modifications in blue, and loops highlight a neighboring `[` or `]` when you place a cursor on them.

But here's where it gets interesting: you actually have access to two editors. The second one, the Macro Editor, is where the magic happens. Instead of writing raw Brainfuck, you can define macros ‚Äì think of them as custom commands that expand into Brainfuck code. Want to clear a cell? Instead of typing `[-]`, you can define a macro called `clear` and just write `@clear`. It's like having your own personal Brainfuck dialect.

### Your First Program

Let's start with something simple. Copy and paste the following code into the main editor (or the macro editor if you prefer):

```brainfuck
++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.
```

This is "Hello World!" in Brainfuck. Intimidating, right? Now click the Run button (the play icon) and watch the magic happen. The program will execute, and you'll see "Hello World!" appear in the output panel. But more importantly, you can watch the memory tape as the program builds up the ASCII values for each letter.

## The Visual Debugger: See Your Code Think

The debugger is where this IDE truly shines. Traditional Brainfuck debugging involves staring at code and mentally tracking pointer positions and cell values. The visual debugger eliminates that cognitive burden entirely.

At the top of the screen, you'll see the memory tape visualization. Each cell shows its current value, and the highlight indicates where your pointer is currently positioned. As your program runs, you can watch the pointer dance across the tape, incrementing and decrementing values, creating patterns that eventually become your output.

### Execution Modes: Choose Your Speed

Not all debugging sessions are the same. Sometimes you want to carefully step through each instruction, and sometimes you just want to see if your program works. That's why IDE offers five different execution modes:

**Step Mode** is perfect when you're learning or debugging a tricky section. Each click advances your program by exactly one instruction, giving you complete control. You can see exactly what each `>`, `<`, `+`, or `-` does to your memory state.

**Smooth Mode** runs your program at a comfortable pace, updating the display frequently enough that you can follow along with the execution. It's like watching a movie of your program running ‚Äì fast enough to be practical, slow enough to understand.

**Turbo Mode** is for when you know your logic is correct and you just want results. The display updates are minimal, prioritizing execution speed over visualization. Your program runs nearly as fast as native Brainfuck, but you still get the safety net of the IDE's error checking.

**Custom Delay Mode** lets you fine-tune the execution speed. Maybe you want a 50ms delay between operations for a presentation, or perhaps 200ms while you're teaching someone. You're in control.

**Rust WASM Mode** unleashes the full power of WebAssembly. Your Brainfuck code is compiled to near-native speed. This mode can execute millions of operations per second, making even complex Brainfuck programs practical to run. And yes, it runs faster than [great interpreter on copy.sh](https://copy.sh/)

### Breakpoints: Pause Where It Matters

Click any line number in the editor, and you'll see a red dot appear ‚Äì you've just set a breakpoint. When your program reaches that line during execution, it will pause, allowing you to inspect the current state of memory. This is invaluable when debugging loops or tracking down why a certain cell isn't getting the value you expected.

You can set multiple breakpoints, and the debugger will stop at each one in sequence. Combined with the Step mode, this gives you surgical precision in understanding your program's behavior.

Even more, I specifically added the `$` character to the Brainfuck language, which allows you to set a breakpoint at the current position in the code. This is especially useful when you want to pause execution at a specific point without having to manually set a breakpoint.

## The Macro System: Write Less, Do More

The macro system transforms Brainfuck from a write-only language into something maintainable and reusable. Open the Macro Editor (it might be hidden by default ‚Äì look for the button to show it), and let's define our first macro:

```brainfuck
#define clear [-]
#define right >
#define left <
#define inc +
#define dec -
```

Now in your main editor, instead of writing `[-]>+++<`, you can write `@clear @right @inc @inc @inc @left`. It's still Brainfuck under the hood, but now it's readable!

But macros can do so much more. They can take parameters:

```brainfuck
#define move(n) {repeat(n, >)}
#define add(n) {repeat(n, +)}

@move(5)  // Moves right 5 cells
@add(10)  // Adds 10 to current cell
```

They can even use control structures:

```brainfuck
#define set_ascii(char) {
    [-]  // Clear current cell
    {repeat(char, +)}  // Add the ASCII value
}

@set_ascii(65)  // Sets cell to 'A'
.  // Prints 'A'
```

### Auto-Expansion: Real-Time Feedback

Enable Auto-Expand in the settings, and watch as your macros are instantly converted to Brainfuck as you type. This immediate feedback helps you catch errors early and understand exactly what your macros are doing. If there's an error in your macro definition, you'll see it highlighted in red with a helpful error message.

## Memory Visualization: Three Ways to See Your Data

The debugger offers three different ways to visualize your memory tape, each suited to different types of programs:

**Normal View** is the standard cell-by-cell display. Each cell shows its decimal value and, when applicable, its ASCII character representation. This is perfect for most Brainfuck programs, especially those working with text.

**Compact View** shrinks the display to fit more cells on screen. When you're working with programs that use hundreds or thousands of cells, this bird's-eye view helps you see patterns in your data that would be invisible in normal view.

**Lane View** is something special. It arranges your memory tape into multiple columns, like a spreadsheet. If you're implementing a matrix multiplication algorithm or working with 2D data structures, lane view makes it obvious what's happening. Set it to 8 lanes, and suddenly you can develop a RISC-like virtual machine right in Brainfuck. Yep, this is how I did it.

## Snapshots: Save Your Progress

Ever wish you could save the exact state of your program's memory and return to it later? That's what snapshots do. Click the camera icon in the sidebar to open the Snapshots panel. At any point during execution (or even when stopped), you can save a snapshot with a custom name.

These snapshots capture everything: the entire memory tape, the pointer position, even any labels you've added to cells. It's like having save states in a video game. Made a mistake? Load your snapshot and try again. Want to compare two different approaches? Save a snapshot of each and switch between them instantly.

## The Output Panel: More Than Just Text

The output panel might seem simple ‚Äì it's where your program's output appears ‚Äì but it has some clever features. You can position it at the bottom of the screen (traditional), on the right side (still traditional, but on the right side).

When you're working with the Assembly workspace, the output panel gains additional tabs. You can see the VM Output (system-level messages) and even a Disassembly view that shows the actual machine instructions being executed. It's like having X-ray vision for your code. (Comment from the author: I just can't handle these AI metaphors. I mean, "X-ray vision"? Really? I will leave it untouched though, so you could also suffer.)

## Settings: Make It Yours

Click the gear icon to access settings, where you can customize almost everything about how the IDE behaves. Here are some key settings to know about:

**Strip Comments** controls whether comments are preserved when macros are expanded. Keep them while learning, remove them for cleaner output. I recommend always keeping it on ‚Äî I swear you will accidentally put a valid Brainfuck command in a comment, and then wonder why your program behaves unexpectedly.

**Auto Expand** toggles real-time macro expansion. This is usually helpful, but for very large macro files, you might want to disable it for better performance.

**Use WASM Expander** switches between JavaScript and WebAssembly for macro processing. WASM is faster, better, and newer, so just ignore the JavaScript option unless you have a specific reason to use it.

**Cell Size** determines whether each memory cell holds 8-bit (0-255), 16-bit (0-65535), or 32-bit values. Most Brainfuck programs expect 8-bit, but larger cells can be useful for mathematical computations.

And a bunch of other settings ‚Äî feel free to explore. Some of them may even completely break stuff!

## The Learning Panel: Your Guide

Click the graduation cap icon to open the Learning panel. Here you'll find interactive tutorials that demonstrate different IDE features. Each tutorial is crafted to highlight specific capabilities:

These aren't just static tutorials ‚Äì they load actual code into the editor and configure the IDE to best demonstrate each concept.

## Keyboard Shortcuts: Work Faster

While the IDE is fully functional with just mouse clicks, keyboard shortcuts can dramatically speed up your workflow:

- **Cmd/Ctrl+F**: Open search in the current editor
- **Cmd/Ctrl+P**: Quick navigation to jump to macros or marked sections

## Advanced Features

### The Assembly Workspace

For those ready to go beyond Brainfuck, the IDE includes a complete assembly language environment for the Ripple Virtual Machine. Enable it in settings to access a RISC-like assembly language with 32 registers, labels, and a proper instruction set. You can write assembly code, compile it to Brainfuck, and even run it directly in the IDE.

## Tips for Success

**Start Simple**: Begin with basic Brainfuck programs before diving into macros. Understanding the fundamentals makes everything else easier.

**Use Comments Liberally**: Brainfuck is notoriously hard to read. Comments are your future self's best friend.

**Label Your Cells**: In the debugger panel, you can assign names to specific memory cells, or lanes/columns in the lane mode. Instead of remembering that cell 7 is your loop counter, label it "counter" and never forget again. You can right click on a cell to set its label, or use the settings panel ‚Äî it is somewhere there.

**Save Snapshots Often**: Before attempting something complex, save a snapshot. It's much easier than trying to manually restore a specific memory state.

**Experiment with View Modes**: Different programs benefit from different visualizations. A text manipulation program might work best in normal view, while a sorting algorithm might be clearer in lane view.

**Use Mark comments**: The IDE supports marking specific lines with comments. This is useful for leaving notes about what a section of code does, or why you made a particular design choice. Use `// MARK: Your comment here` to create a marked section. You can then quickly navigate to these marks using the quick nav feature (Cmd/Ctrl+P), or use the "Marks" panel to see all your marked sections in one place.

## Common Patterns and Solutions

**Infinite Loops**: If your program seems stuck, pause it and check the current cell value. Often, a loop condition isn't being decremented properly.

**Off-by-One Errors**: Use the step debugger to verify your pointer movements. It's easy to move one cell too far or not far enough.

**Value Overflow**: With 8-bit cells, incrementing 255 gives you 0. This wrapping behavior can cause unexpected results if you're not careful.

## Your Journey Starts Here

This IDE represents A WHOLE MONTH of pain, suffering, real coding, vibe coding, brainfuck coding, meta programming, assembly coding, Rust coding, fucking C compiler coding, and other coding aimed at making Brainfuck not just possible to write, but genuinely enjoyable to work with. Whether you're here to challenge yourself, to learn about low-level programming concepts, or just to have fun with an esoteric language, you have all the tools you need.

Start with the tutorials in the Learning panel, experiment with the different execution modes, and don't be afraid to use the macro system to make your life easier. Brainfuck might be minimal by design, but your development experience doesn't have to be.

Happy coding, and remember: in Brainfuck, every character counts, but with this IDE, you can make them all count for something meaningful.

### Note from the author

Holy hell that was a journey. And I just wanted to make a snake game in Brainfuck ‚Äî and somehow accidentally reinvented the whole computer science.

I hope you have some fun. After all, Brainfuck is Turing-complete.

# Settings & Configuration: Making the IDE Yours

Comment from the author: with every new tutorial this AI seems to get more and more ridiculous. Nerve center? Control Room? World of fucking customization?

I will probably never rewrite it though.

## The Control Room

Welcome to the nerve center of your IDE ‚Äì the Settings panel. Click that gear icon in the sidebar and you enter a world of customization that can transform your Brainfuck development experience. Whether you're a speed demon who needs maximum performance or a careful learner who wants to see every step, these settings let you tune the IDE to match exactly how you work.

Every setting you change is automatically saved in your browser's localStorage. Close the IDE, come back a week later, and everything is exactly as you left it. It's like having a personal workspace that remembers you.

## The Macro Settings: Your Code Generation Engine

The macro system is the heart of advanced Brainfuck programming, and these settings control how it behaves. Let's explore what each one does and, more importantly, when you should care.

### Strip Comments: The Clean-Up Crew

When your macros expand into Brainfuck, what happens to all those helpful comments you wrote? This setting decides their fate.

**On by default**, and here's why: When you're actually running Brainfuck code, comments are dead weight. They make your expanded code longer, your files bigger, and scrolling more tedious. With this on, your beautiful commented macro code becomes lean, mean Brainfuck.

But sometimes you want those comments. When you're learning how macros expand, or debugging why something went wrong, those comments are breadcrumbs through the forest. Turn this off and every comment survives the expansion, helping you understand the journey from macro to Brainfuck.

My advice? Keep it on unless you're actively debugging macro expansion. Your scrollbar will thank you.

### Collapse Empty Lines: The Space Saver

Macros often generate code with lots of empty lines ‚Äì they're artifacts of the expansion process, like the leftover flour on a baker's counter. This setting is your choice: keep the mess for readability, or clean it up for compactness.

**Off by default** because those empty lines often serve a purpose. They separate logical sections, make the code breathable, give your eyes a rest. When you're reading expanded code, these gaps are like paragraph breaks in a book.

But when you're looking at the final product, when you want to see as much code as possible on screen, when you're sharing code with others ‚Äì flip this on. Your 500-line expanded program might shrink to 300 lines of pure, dense Brainfuck.

### Auto Expand: The Real-Time Compiler

This is the magic setting. With Auto Expand on, every keystroke in the Macro Editor triggers an expansion. You see your Brainfuck being generated in real-time, like watching a 3D printer build your design layer by layer.

**On by default** because the feedback is invaluable. Type a macro invocation, see the Brainfuck instantly. Make a typo, see the error immediately. It's like having a compiler that never stops running, catching mistakes before they become mysteries.

But power comes at a price. If you're working with huge macro files ‚Äì we're talking thousands of lines ‚Äì that constant recompilation can make the editor sluggish. Every keystroke triggers a full expansion, and suddenly you're waiting a half-second for each character to appear. That's when you turn this off and expand manually when you're ready.

### Use WASM Expander: The Speed Boost

JavaScript is great, but WebAssembly is faster. Like, 5 to 10 times faster. This setting chooses which engine powers your macro expansion.

**On by default** because who doesn't want free performance? The WASM expander tears through even complex macro expansions in milliseconds. It's the difference between waiting and not waiting, between smooth and stuttering.

So why would you ever turn it off? Debugging. When something goes wrong with macro expansion itself ‚Äì not your macros, but the expander ‚Äì the JavaScript version is much easier to debug. You can set breakpoints, inspect variables, understand what's happening. It's like the difference between a race car and a regular car: the race car is faster, but when it breaks, good luck fixing it without specialized tools.

For 99.9% of users, leave this on. For that 0.1% debugging the actual expander, you know who you are.

## Debugger Settings: Your Window into the Machine

The debugger is where you watch your code come alive, and these settings control what you see and how you see it.

### View Mode: Three Ways to Watch

Your memory tape can be visualized in three completely different ways. It's like having three different microscopes for examining your data.

**Normal View** is the goldilocks option ‚Äì not too much, not too little, just right. Each cell displays its value clearly, shows ASCII characters when relevant, and gives you enough context without overwhelming you. This is where most people live.

**Compact View** is for when you need the big picture. Working with a thousand cells? Normal view would have you scrolling forever. Compact view shrinks everything down, trading detail for overview. You can see patterns, identify regions of activity, spot the one cell that's different. It's like zooming out on a map to see the whole country instead of your street.

**Lane View** is the secret weapon. Instead of a long line of cells, arrange them in columns. Suddenly, your linear tape becomes a 2D grid. Working with matrix math? Use lane view. Implementing a virtual machine with 8-byte words? Set 8 lanes and watch your data align perfectly. This is the view that makes complex data structures visible.

### Show Disassembly: For the Brave

When you enable the Assembly workspace, you unlock the ability to see actual machine instructions. This setting controls whether you want that power.

**Off by default** because most Brainfuck programmers don't need to see VM instructions. It's an extra layer of complexity, another panel taking up space, more information to process.

But if you're debugging at the VM level, if you're trying to understand how your Brainfuck becomes machine code, if you're one of those people who reads assembly for fun (you know who you are), turn this on. The disassembly view shows you exactly what instructions are being executed, what registers hold what values, how the virtual machine is interpreting your code.

### Lane Count: Your Grid Dimension

When you're in Lane View, this decides how many columns you see. It's like choosing between ruled paper, graph paper, or engineering paper.

**Default is 4** because it's a nice, manageable number. Four columns fit well on most screens, make patterns visible without being overwhelming.

But the right number depends on your data. Working with 16-bit values split across two cells? Use 2 lanes. Implementing an 8x8 game board? Use 8 lanes. Processing RGB values? Use 3 lanes. The limit is 32, which is probably more than your screen can handle, but it's there if you need it.

## Assembly Settings: The Power User Zone

These settings only matter if you've enabled the Assembly workspace. If you're just doing Brainfuck, skip this section. But if you're ready to go deeper...

### Show Workspace: The Gateway Drug

This is the master switch. Turn it on and suddenly your IDE grows new powers. An Assembly tab appears, new toolbar buttons materialize, the Output panel gains new abilities. It's like finding a hidden room in a house you thought you knew.

**Off by default** because assembly programming isn't why most people come to a Brainfuck IDE. It adds complexity, uses more memory, might confuse beginners.

But if you're curious about low-level programming, if you want to see how a virtual machine works, if you're implementing a compiler that targets the Ripple VM ‚Äì flip this switch and enter a new world.

### Auto Compile: The Eager Assistant

When you're writing assembly, this setting controls whether it compiles automatically as you type.

**Off by default** because compilation takes time and CPU. Every change triggers a full assembly, link, and validation pass. For small programs it's instant, but as your code grows, those milliseconds add up.

Turn it on when you're actively developing and want immediate feedback. Every syntax error appears instantly, every successful compile gives you that little dopamine hit. Turn it off when you're doing major refactoring and don't want the distraction of constant compilation.

### Bank Size: Your Memory Architecture

The Ripple VM divides memory into banks. This setting controls how big those banks are. It's deeply technical and honestly, most people should leave it alone.

**Default is 64000** because it's large enough for serious programs but small enough to be manageable. Think of it like choosing the page size in a notebook ‚Äì too small and you're constantly flipping pages, too large and you waste paper.

If you're implementing something specific that needs different banking, you already know what value you need. If you're not sure, stick with the default.

## Interpreter Settings: The Brainfuck Brain

These control how the Brainfuck interpreter itself behaves. They affect compatibility, safety, and what kinds of programs you can run.

### Wrap Cells: The Overflow Policy

What happens when you increment 255 in an 8-bit cell? This setting decides.

**On by default** because that's standard Brainfuck behavior. 255 + 1 = 0, like a car odometer rolling over. It's predictable, it's what most programs expect, it's mathematically clean (modulo arithmetic).

Turn it off and you enter the wild west. 255 + 1 = 256, cells can hold negative numbers, arithmetic works differently. Some algorithms break, others become possible. It's useful for certain kinds of debugging, but most programs will misbehave.

### Wrap Tape: The Edge of the World

What happens when you move past the last cell of the tape? Do you fall off the edge or wrap around to the beginning?

**On by default** for safety. When you hit the edge, you wrap around. It's like Pac-Man going off one side of the screen and appearing on the other. No crashes, no errors, just seamless continuation.

Turn it off for debugging. Now when you move past the edge, the program stops with an error. This catches pointer bugs that wrapping would hide. If your pointer is at cell 29999 and you move right, wrapping would put you at cell 0 silently. With wrapping off, you get an error that says "hey, you just tried to leave the tape!"

### Cell Size: How Big is a Byte?

Most Brainfuck uses 8-bit cells (0-255), but the IDE supports 16-bit (0-65535) and 32-bit (0-4294967295) cells too.

**8-bit is standard**. It's what Brainfuck was designed for, what most programs expect, what makes sense for ASCII output.

**16-bit** is useful for Unicode, larger numbers, certain algorithms that need more range. Your "Hello World" still works, but now you can also say "‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïå".

**32-bit** is for when you're doing serious computation. Scientific calculations, large number processing, or just because you can. The trade-off is memory usage ‚Äì each cell takes 4 times as much space.

### Tape Size: Your Memory Budget

How many cells do you get to play with? The default 30000 is traditional, but you can go from 1 (why would you?) to 10 million (why would you?!).

**30000 is plenty** for most programs. It's enough to implement complex algorithms, store substantial data, build virtual machines.

Go smaller for debugging ‚Äì a 100-cell tape makes it easy to see everything at once. Go larger for ambitious projects ‚Äì implementing a compiler might need millions of cells.

But remember: larger tapes use more memory, take longer to initialize, and might hit browser limits. Your browser has to allocate a contiguous array for the entire tape, even if you only use 10 cells.

## Performance: The Hidden Settings

Some settings aren't in the panel but happen automatically based on what you're doing.

When your tape exceeds 10,000 cells, the renderer switches to optimized mode. Updates batch together, scrolling becomes virtual, only visible cells render. You don't see a setting for this because the IDE knows when to do it.

When you're in Turbo mode, visualization updates become rare. The IDE prioritizes execution speed over visual feedback. Again, no setting needed ‚Äì the IDE adapts.

This is the philosophy: manual settings for things you might want to control, automatic optimization for things the IDE can figure out itself.

## Import/Export: Taking Your Settings With You

Your settings live in localStorage, which means they're tied to this browser on this computer. Want to move them somewhere else? Here's how.

### Backing Up Your World

Open your browser's developer console (F12, then click Console). Type:

```javascript
JSON.stringify(localStorage);
```

That spits out all your settings as a text string. Copy it, save it somewhere safe. It's your IDE configuration captured in a bottle.

### Restoring Your Settings

Got that settings string? In the console, type:

```javascript
Object.assign(localStorage, JSON.parse("your-settings-string-here"));
```

Refresh the page and boom ‚Äì your IDE is exactly as you left it. It's like teleporting your workspace to a new computer.

### Starting Fresh

Sometimes you want to wipe everything clean. In the console:

```javascript
localStorage.clear();
```

Refresh, and you're back to factory defaults. Every setting returns to its original state, like the IDE was just installed.

## Setting Recipes: Configurations for Every Occasion

### The Learner's Setup

- Auto Expand: ON (see expansions immediately)
- Strip Comments: OFF (keep all explanations)
- View Mode: Normal (clearest display)
- Custom Delay: 100ms (slow enough to follow)
- Cell Size: 8-bit (standard Brainfuck)

Perfect for tutorials, understanding how things work, building intuition.

### The Speed Demon

- Auto Expand: OFF (manual control)
- Strip Comments: ON (minimal output)
- View Mode: Compact (maximum visibility)
- Use WASM: ON (fastest expansion)
- Execution: Turbo or WASM mode

When you need maximum performance and know what you're doing.

### The Detective

- Auto Expand: OFF (control when things happen)
- Strip Comments: OFF (preserve all information)
- View Mode: Lane (structured view)
- Show Disassembly: ON (if using assembly)
- Execution: Step mode

For hunting bugs, understanding problems, solving mysteries.

### The Teacher

- Auto Expand: ON (immediate feedback)
- Strip Comments: OFF (keep explanations)
- View Mode: Normal or Lane (depending on lesson)
- Custom Delay: 200ms (comfortable pace)
- Larger font size (if available)

Making Brainfuck understandable for others.

## Troubleshooting: When Settings Go Wrong

**Everything is slow**: Turn off Auto Expand for large files, reduce tape size, use compact view, enable WASM.

**Can't see my code**: Wrong view mode? Too many panels open? Try resetting view settings.

**Macros won't expand**: Check Auto Expand is on, verify WASM is working (try turning it off), look for errors in macro syntax.

**Out of memory**: Reduce tape size, clear snapshots, close unused panels, restart browser.

**Settings won't save**: localStorage might be full or disabled. Check browser settings, clear old data.

## The Philosophy of Settings

Good settings disappear. You configure them once and forget they exist. Bad settings require constant fiddling. The IDE tries hard to make its settings good settings.

That's why some things are automatic (performance optimizations), some have smart defaults (most people never need to change them), and some are prominently placed (the ones you'll actually use).

The goal isn't to give you every possible option ‚Äì it's to give you the right options. The ones that actually matter for how you work with Brainfuck.

## Your Settings Journey

When you start, you'll probably use defaults for everything. That's fine ‚Äì they're good defaults, chosen carefully.

As you grow, you'll discover preferences. Maybe you like compact view for large programs. Maybe you prefer manual macro expansion. Maybe 16-bit cells open new possibilities.

Eventually, you'll have your perfect setup. Your IDE will feel like a tailored suit, fitting exactly how you work. Export those settings, guard them carefully. They're not just configuration ‚Äì they're your personal development environment, tuned through experience.

Welcome to your control room. Every switch, dial, and button is here for a reason. Use them wisely, and the IDE becomes not just a tool, but your tool.

## Architecture Overview

The Ripple VM is a 16-bit RISC architecture designed for efficient implementation in Brainfuck. It features:

The ISA is called "Perfectly Engineered Non-standard Instruction Set".

- **16-bit word size**: Values range from 0 to 65,535
- **32 general-purpose registers**: Including special-purpose registers
- **4-word instructions**: Each instruction is 64 bits (4 √ó 16-bit words)
- **Bank-based memory**: 65536 instructions per bank
- **Load/Store architecture**: Only LOAD/STORE instructions access memory
- **No flags register**: Comparisons set registers to 0 or 1

### Key Design Principles

2. **No modes** - Each instruction does exactly one thing
3. **Orthogonal design** - Any register can be used in any instruction
4. **Simple pipeline** - Fetch/Decode/Execute/Memory/Writeback

## Register Architecture

The Ripple VM features 32 registers with both numeric and symbolic names:

## Memory Model

### Address Calculation

```
absoluteCell = PCB √ó BANK_SIZE + PC √ó 4 + localWord
```

### Memory Layout

- **Bank Size**: BANK_SIZE instructions
- **Total Address Space**: 65,536 banks √ó BANK_SIZE instructions
- **Word Size**: 16 bits
- **Instruction Size**: 4 words (64 bits)

### Memory-Mapped I/O

| Address | Name     | Description                    |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0x0000  | OUT      | Write byte to host stdout      |
| 0x0001  | OUT_FLAG | Host ready flag (1 when ready) |

## Assembly Syntax

### Basic Syntax Rules

- **Case-insensitive**: `ADD`, `add`, and `Add` are equivalent
- **Comments**: Use `;` or `//` for line comments
- **Labels**: End with colon, e.g., `loop:`
- **Immediates**: Decimal by default, `0x` prefix for hex, `0b` for binary

### Example Assembly Code

```assembly
; Function to multiply by 10
multiply_by_10:
    ; S0 = A0 * 10
    MULI S0, A0, 10   ; Multiply first argument by 10
    JALR R0, RA       ; Return

; Main program
main:
    LI   A0, 7        ; Load 7 into first argument
    JAL  multiply_by_10
    ; Result is now in RV0
```

### Directives

| Directive | Description                   | Example           |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `.code`   | Start code section            | `.code`           |
| `.data`   | Start data section            | `.data`           |
| `.word`   | Define 16-bit word            | `.word 0x1234`    |
| `.byte`   | Define 8-bit byte             | `.byte 65`        |
| `.space`  | Reserve space                 | `.space 100`      |
| `.ascii`  | Define ASCII string           | `.ascii "Hello"`  |
| `.asciiz` | Define null-terminated string | `.asciiz "World"` |

## Calling Convention

### Register Usage

- **Arguments**: A0-A3 (first 4 arguments)
- **Return Values**: RV0-RV1 (can return 32-bit values)
- **Caller-saved**: T0-T7 (must save before call if needed)
- **Callee-saved**: S0-S3 (function must preserve)
- **Stack**: Additional arguments at SP+offset

### Function Prologue/Epilogue

```assembly
function:
    ; Prologue - save callee-saved registers
    ADDI  SP, SP, -3      ; Allocate stack space
    STORE S0, SP, 0       ; Save S0
    STORE S1, SP, 1       ; Save S1
    STORE RA, SP, 2       ; Save return address

    ; Function body
    ; ... use S0, S1 freely ...

    ; Epilogue - restore registers
    LOAD  S0, SP, 0       ; Restore S0
    LOAD  S1, SP, 1       ; Restore S1
    LOAD  RA, SP, 2       ; Restore return address
    ADDI  SP, SP, 3       ; Deallocate stack
    JALR  R0, RA          ; Return
```

## Pseudo-Instructions

The assembler provides convenient pseudo-instructions that expand to real instructions:

| Pseudo        | Expansion                          | Description          |

## Programming Examples

TBD

## System Integration

### Linking with C Runtime

The Ripple VM can be targeted by the Ripple C Compiler (rcc), which generates assembly code following these conventions:

```assembly
; C function example
; int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
_add:
    ADD   RV0, A0, A1     ; Result in RV0
    JALR  R0, RA          ; Return
```

### Debug Support

The BRK instruction triggers debugger breakpoints, allowing:

- Register inspection
- Memory examination
- Single-step execution
- Breakpoint management

## Performance Considerations

It is a Brainfuck-based architecture, so performance is predictable:

`D.I.S.A.S.T.E.R.`

## Summary

The Ripple VM provides a clean, orthogonal RISC architecture that's both powerful and predictable. Its 32-register design eliminates many bottlenecks found in smaller register sets, while the simple instruction formats make both assembly programming and compiler development straightforward.

Key advantages:

- **Rich register set** reduces memory traffic
- **Simple addressing** makes code generation easier
- **Clean design** minimizes surprises
- **Future-proof** with reserved registers for extensions

## Introduction

The Brainfuck Advanced Language Layer System macro preprocessor extends the standard Brainfuck language with powerful macro capabilities, making it easier to write complex programs. The preprocessor expands macros before the Brainfuck interpreter executes the code.

### Key Features

- Macro definitions with optional parameters
- Built-in functions for repetition, conditionals, and iteration
- Array literals and operations
- Source preservation for embedding non-Brainfuck content
- Nested macro invocations

## Basic Macro Definitions

### Simple Macros

Define a macro using `#define` followed by the macro name and body:

```brainfuck
#define right >
#define left <
#define inc +
#define dec -
#define output .
#define input ,
#define loop_start [
#define loop_end ]

// Usage
@right @inc @output
// Expands to: >+.
```

### Multi-line Macros

Use curly braces for multi-line macro definitions:

```brainfuck
#define clear {
    [-]
}

#define move_right {
    [->>+<<]
    >>
}
```

### Line Continuation

Use backslash for line continuation in single-line macros:

```brainfuck
#define long_sequence > + > + > + \
                      < < < - \
                      > > > .
```

## Macro Invocation

Macros are invoked using the `@` symbol (or `#` for aesthetic preference ‚Äî they are equivalent, but highlighted differently):

```brainfuck
#define cell_zero [-]

@cell_zero    // Clear current cell
#cell_zero    // Alternative syntax
```

## Parametric Macros

### Basic Parameters

Define macros with parameters by adding parentheses after the name:

```brainfuck
#define move(n) {repeat(n, >)}
#define add(n) {repeat(n, +)}
#define subtract(n) {repeat(n, -)}

@move(5)       // Expands to: >>>>>
@add(10)       // Expands to: ++++++++++
```

### Multiple Parameters

```brainfuck
#define set_value(cell, value) {
    @move(cell)
    [-]
    @add(value)
}

@set_value(3, 65)  // Move to cell 3, clear it, set to 65 (ASCII 'A')
```

### Parameter Substitution in Complex Expressions

```brainfuck
#define copy_cell(from, to, temp) {
    @move(from)
    [
        @move(temp) +
        @move(to) +
        @move(from) -
    ]
    @move(temp)
    [
        @move(from) +
        @move(temp) -
    ]
}
```

## Built-in Functions

### {repeat(count, content)}

Repeats content a specified number of times:

```brainfuck
{repeat(5, >)}          // >>>>>
{repeat(10, +)}         // ++++++++++
{repeat(3, [-]>)}       // [-]>[-]>[-]>
```

### {if(condition, true_branch, false_branch)}

Conditional expansion based on a numeric condition:

```brainfuck
#define DEBUG 1
#define log(msg) {if(#DEBUG, msg)}

@log(.)  // Outputs only if DEBUG is 1
```

### {for(variable in array, body)}

Iterates over array elements:

```brainfuck
{for(i in {1, 2, 3}, {repeat(i, +)})}
// Expands to: + ++ +++

#define chars {65, 66, 67}
{for(c in @chars, [-]@add(c).)}
// Sets each cell to ASCII A, B, C and outputs them
```

### {reverse(array)}

Reverses an array:

```brainfuck
{reverse({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})}     // {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}

#define sequence {a, b, c}
{reverse(@sequence)}            // {c, b, a}
```

## Array Literals and Operations

### Array Literals

Arrays are defined using curly braces:

```brainfuck
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}              // Numeric array
{a, b, c}                     // Text array
{'A', 'B', 'C'}               // Character literals (converted to ASCII)
{0x41, 0x42, 0x43}           // Hexadecimal numbers
```

### Array Operations with Macros

```brainfuck
#define ASCII_LETTERS {65, 66, 67, 68, 69}
#define REVERSED_LETTERS {reverse(@ASCII_LETTERS)}

{for(letter in @REVERSED_LETTERS, [-]@add(letter).)}
// Outputs: EDCBA
```

## Control Flow

### For Loop with Index

Access both value and index in iterations:

```brainfuck
{for(val, idx in {A, B, C},
    Index: idx Value: val{br}
)}
// Output:
// Index: 0 Value: A
// Index: 1 Value: B
// Index: 2 Value: C
```

### Conditional Compilation

```brainfuck
#define MODE 1  // 0=debug, 1=release

#define debug_print {if(@MODE, , .)}
#define optimize_loop {if(@MODE,
    [-],              // Simple clear in release
    [->+<]            // Slower but traceable in debug
)}
```

## Advanced Features

### Nested Macro Invocations

```brainfuck
#define inner(x) {repeat(x, +)}
#define outer(n) @inner(n)>@inner(n)

@outer(3)  // Expands to: +++>+++
```

### Character and String Handling

```brainfuck
#define print_char(c) [-]{repeat(c, +)}.

@print_char('A')     // Prints 'A'
@print_char(0x41)    // Also prints 'A' (hex)
@print_char(65)      // Also prints 'A' (decimal)
```

### Building Complex Data Structures

```brainfuck
#define STRING_HELLO {72, 101, 108, 108, 111}
#define STRING_WORLD {87, 111, 114, 108, 100}

#define print_string(str) {
    {for(char in str,
        [-]              // Clear cell
        @add(char)       // Set to character
        .                // Output
    )}
}

@print_string(@STRING_HELLO)
@print_char(32)  // Space
@print_string(@STRING_WORLD)
// Output: Hello World
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Names

```brainfuck
// Good
#define clear_cell [-]
#define move_pointer_right >

// Avoid
#define c [-]
#define m >
```

### 2. Create Abstraction Layers

```brainfuck
// Low level
#define ptr_right >
#define ptr_left <

// Mid level
#define goto_cell(n) {repeat(n, @ptr_right)}
#define return_from_cell(n) {repeat(n, @ptr_left)}

// High level
#define with_cell(n, ops) {
    @goto_cell(n)
    ops
    @return_from_cell(n)
}
```

### 3. Document Your Macros

```brainfuck
// Copies value from current cell to cell+n using cell+n+1 as temp
#define copy_to(n) [>@move(n)+>+<<@move(n)-]>>@move(n)[<<@move(n)+>>@move(n)-]

// Sets cell to ASCII value of digit (0-9)
#define digit_to_ascii(d) [-]{repeat(48, +)}{repeat(d, +)}
```

### 4. Use Constants

```brainfuck
#define BUFFER_SIZE 10
#define ASCII_ZERO 48
#define ASCII_A 65
#define NEWLINE 10

#define allocate_buffer {repeat(#BUFFER_SIZE, >[-]<)}
```

## Error Handling

The macro expander provides helpful error messages:

```brainfuck
// Error: Undefined macro
@undefined_macro

// Error: Parameter mismatch
#define test(a, b) a+b
@test(1)  // Expects 2 parameters, got 1

// Error: Circular dependency (when detection enabled)
#define a @b
#define b @a
@a
```

## CLI Usage

The macro expander can be used from the command line:

```bash
# Expand a file
bfm expand input.bfm > output.bf

# List all macros
bfm list input.bfm

# Validate macro definitions
bfm validate input.bfm
```

## Summary

The Brainfuck Advanced Language Layer System provides powerful abstractions that make Brainfuck programming more manageable:

- **Macros** for code reuse and abstraction
- **Parameters** for flexible, reusable components
- **Built-in functions** for common operations
- **Arrays** for data organization
- **Control flow** for complex logic

By combining these features, you can write maintainable and sophisticated Brainfuck programs that would be impractical with raw Brainfuck alone.

# V2 Backend Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap provides a complete guide for implementing the remaining components of the V2 backend. The V2 infrastructure (register management, function structure, calling convention) is complete and tested. This document outlines the steps to implement instruction lowering and integrate V2 into the main compilation pipeline.

**Latest Update (Phase 2 Complete!)**: All Phase 2 instructions are now fully implemented! Binary operations, comparison operations, and branch instructions are all working. The branch module supports both conditional and unconditional branches, with proper handling of comparison-based branching patterns. All branches use relative addressing (BEQ/BNE/BLT/BGE) as required by the VM. Unconditional branches are implemented using BEQ R0, R0, label. 211+ tests passing across all V2 modules.

## Current State

### ‚úÖ Completed Components

- **Register Management** (`regmgmt/`) - Automatic R13 init, LRU spilling, bank tracking
- **Function Structure** (`function.rs`) - Prologue/epilogue with correct R13 initialization
- **Calling Convention** (`calling_convention.rs`) - Stack-based parameters, fat pointer returns
- **Parameter Type Tracking** - Correct handling of mixed scalar/fat pointer parameters
- **Callee-Saved Register Preservation** - S0-S3 properly saved/restored in prologue/epilogue
- **Unified Parameter Placement Logic** - Consistent behavior between caller and callee
- **Load Instruction** (`instr/load.rs`) - Loads from global/stack with proper bank handling
- **Store Instruction** (`instr/store.rs`) - Stores to global/stack with fat pointer support
- **GEP Instruction** (`instr/gep.rs`) - Full runtime bank overflow handling with DIV/MOD
- **Binary Operations** (`instr/binary/`) - All arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations with Sethi-Ullman ordering
- **Branch Instructions** (`instr/branch.rs`) - Conditional and unconditional branches with label support
- **Test Infrastructure** - 211+ passing tests across all V2 modules

### ‚ùå Missing Components

- Integration with main IR lowering pipeline

## Critical Development Practices

### Comprehensive Logging Requirements

**MANDATORY**: All new code MUST include comprehensive logging using the `log` crate:

1. **Use appropriate log levels**:

   - `trace!()` - Detailed execution flow, variable states, intermediate values
   - `debug!()` - Key decisions, register allocations, spills, important state changes
   - `info!()` - High-level operation summaries (reserved for major milestones)
   - `warn!()` - Recoverable issues, fallback behaviors
   - `error!()` - Unrecoverable errors before panicking

2. **What to log**:

   - **Entry/exit of major functions**: `debug!("lower_load: ptr={:?}, type={:?}", ptr, ty);`
   - **Register allocation decisions**: `debug!("Allocated {:?} for '{}'", reg, value);`
   - **Spill/reload operations**: `debug!("Spilling '{}' to slot {}", value, slot);`
   - **Bank calculations**: `trace!("GEP: base_bank={}, offset={}, new_bank={}", ...);`
   - **Instruction generation**: `trace!("Generated: {:?}", inst);`
   - **State before/after operations**: `trace!("Register state: {:?}", reg_contents);`

3. **Example logging pattern**:

```rust
pub fn lower_load(
    mgr: &mut RegisterPressureManager,
    ptr_value: &Value,
    result_type: &Type,
    result_name: String,
) -> Vec<AsmInst> {
    debug!("lower_load: ptr={:?}, type={:?}, result={}", ptr_value, result_type, result_name);
    trace!("  Current register state: {:?}", mgr.get_debug_state());

    let mut insts = vec![];

    // Get pointer components
    let addr_reg = match ptr_value {
        Value::Temp(t) => {
            let reg = mgr.get_register(format!("t{}", t.0));
            trace!("  Got address register {:?} for temp {}", reg, t.0);
            reg
        }
        // ...
    };

    // Get bank info
    let bank_info = mgr.get_pointer_bank(&ptr_value_name);
    debug!("  Pointer bank info: {:?}", bank_info);

    // Generate instruction
    let inst = AsmInst::Load { rd: dest_reg, bank: bank_reg, addr: addr_reg };
    trace!("  Generated LOAD: {:?}", inst);
    insts.push(inst);

    debug!("lower_load complete: generated {} instructions", insts.len());
    insts
}
```

4. **Running with debug output**:

```bash
# Enable trace logging for register management
RUST_LOG=rcc_ir::regmgmt=trace cargo test

# Enable debug logging for all V2 components
RUST_LOG=rcc_ir::v2=debug cargo build --release

# Full trace for debugging
RUST_LOG=trace cargo run -- compile test.c
```

5. **Benefits of comprehensive logging**:
   - **Debugging**: Quickly identify where things go wrong
   - **Understanding**: Trace execution flow during development
   - **Optimization**: Identify inefficiencies (excessive spills, etc.)
   - **Testing**: Verify correct behavior in tests
   - **Maintenance**: Future developers can understand decisions

**NOTE**: The V2 register management module now has comprehensive logging (added in this session). Use it as a reference for logging patterns.

## Phase 1: Memory Operations (Week 1) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Task 1.1: Implement Load Instruction Lowering ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**File created**: `rcc-ir/src/v2/instr/load.rs`

**Implementation completed**:

- ‚úÖ Loads from global memory with GP register
- ‚úÖ Loads from stack memory with SB register
- ‚úÖ Dynamic bank support for runtime-determined banks
- ‚úÖ Fat pointer loading (both address and bank components)
- ‚úÖ Proper integration with RegisterPressureManager
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive unit and integration tests

**Original implementation steps**:

1. Create the load module structure:

```rust
use rcc_frontend::ir::{Value, Type};
use crate::regmgmt::{RegisterPressureManager, BankInfo};
use rcc_codegen::{AsmInst, Reg};
use log::{debug, trace};

pub fn lower_load(
    mgr: &mut RegisterPressureManager,
    ptr_value: &Value,
    result_type: &Type,
    result_name: String,
) -> Vec<AsmInst> {
    debug!("lower_load: ptr={:?}, type={:?}, result={}", ptr_value, result_type, result_name);
    let mut insts = vec![];

    // 1. Get pointer components (address and bank)
    let addr_reg = match ptr_value {
        Value::Temp(t) => {
            let reg = mgr.get_register(format!("t{}", t.0));
            trace!("  Got address register {:?} for temp {}", reg, t.0);
            reg
        }
        Value::Local(idx) => {
            // Load local pointer from stack
            // Address at FP+idx, bank at FP+idx+1
            debug!("  Loading local pointer {} from stack", idx);
            // Implementation here
            todo!("Load local pointer")
        }
        _ => {
            error!("Invalid pointer value for load: {:?}", ptr_value);
            panic!("Invalid pointer value for load")
        }
    };

    // 2. Get bank register based on pointer's bank info
    let bank_info = mgr.get_pointer_bank(&ptr_value_name);
    debug!("  Pointer bank info: {:?}", bank_info);
    let bank_reg = match bank_info {
        BankInfo::Global => {
            trace!("  Using Gp for global bank pointer");
            Reg::Gp   // Global bank pointer (Gp)
        }
        BankInfo::Stack => {
            trace!("  Using R13 for stack bank");
            Reg::Sb   // Stack bank (already initialized)
        }
        BankInfo::Register(r) => {
            trace!("  Using {:?} for dynamic bank", r);
            r    // Dynamic bank
        }
    };

    // 3. Allocate destination register
    let dest_reg = mgr.get_register(result_name.clone());

    // 4. Generate LOAD instruction
    let load_inst = AsmInst::Load {
        rd: dest_reg,
        bank: bank_reg,
        addr: addr_reg,
    };
    trace!("  Generated LOAD: {:?}", load_inst);
    insts.push(load_inst);

    // 5. If loading a fat pointer, also load the bank component
    if result_type.is_pointer() {
        debug!("  Loading fat pointer - need to load bank component");
        let bank_addr = /* calculate addr + 1 */;
        let bank_dest = mgr.get_register(format!("{}_bank", result_name));
        let bank_load = AsmInst::Load {
            rd: bank_dest,
            bank: bank_reg,
            addr: bank_addr,
        };
        trace!("  Generated bank LOAD: {:?}", bank_load);
        insts.push(bank_load);
        mgr.set_pointer_bank(result_name, BankInfo::Register(bank_dest));
        debug!("  Fat pointer loaded: addr in {:?}, bank in {:?}", dest_reg, bank_dest);
    }

    debug!("lower_load complete: generated {} instructions", insts.len());
    insts
}
```

**Testing**:

- Test loading from global memory (bank 0)
- Test loading from stack (bank 1 with R13)
- Test loading fat pointers (both components)
- Test with register pressure (spilling)

### Task 1.2: Implement Store Instruction Lowering ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**File created**: `rcc-ir/src/v2/instr/store.rs`

**Implementation completed**:

- ‚úÖ Stores to global memory with GP register
- ‚úÖ Stores to stack memory with SB register
- ‚úÖ Dynamic bank support for runtime-determined banks
- ‚úÖ Fat pointer storing (both address and bank components)
- ‚úÖ Immediate value handling (loading into registers first)
- ‚úÖ Proper integration with RegisterPressureManager
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive unit and integration tests

**Original implementation steps**:

1. Similar structure to load but reversed:

```rust
pub fn lower_store(
    mgr: &mut RegisterPressureManager,
    value: &Value,
    ptr_value: &Value,
) -> Vec<AsmInst> {
    // 1. Get value to store
    // 2. Get pointer components
    // 3. Get bank register
    // 4. Generate STORE instruction
    // 5. If storing fat pointer, store both components
}
```

**Critical considerations**:

- Ensure R13 is already initialized (done by RegisterPressureManager)
- Handle immediate values that need to be loaded into registers first
- Correctly identify bank from pointer provenance

### Task 1.3: Implement GEP with Bank Overflow Handling ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**File created**: `rcc-ir/src/v2/instr/gep.rs`

**Implementation completed**:

- ‚úÖ Full runtime bank overflow handling with DIV/MOD instructions
- ‚úÖ Static offset optimization for compile-time known indices
- ‚úÖ Power-of-2 element size optimization using shift instructions
- ‚úÖ Support for Stack, Global, and dynamic bank pointers
- ‚úÖ Proper fat pointer propagation through GEP operations
- ‚úÖ 13 unit tests covering all GEP scenarios
- ‚úÖ 10 integration tests with load/store operations
- ‚úÖ Chained GEP support for multi-dimensional arrays

**Original implementation steps**:

```rust
use log::{debug, trace, warn};

pub fn lower_gep(
    mgr: &mut RegisterPressureManager,
    base_ptr: &Value,
    indices: &[Value],
    element_size: i16,
    result_name: String,
) -> Vec<AsmInst> {
    debug!("lower_gep: base={:?}, indices={:?}, elem_size={}, result={}",
           base_ptr, indices, element_size, result_name);
    let mut insts = vec![];

    // 1. Get base pointer components
    let base_addr = /* get address register */;
    let base_bank_info = mgr.get_pointer_bank(&base_ptr_name);

    // 2. Calculate total offset
    // total_offset = sum(index[i] * stride[i])

    // 3. CRITICAL: Handle bank overflow
    // For static offsets:
    if let Some(static_offset) = try_get_static_offset(indices) {
        let total_offset = base_addr_value + static_offset;
        trace!("  Static offset: base={} + offset={} = total={}",
               base_addr_value, static_offset, total_offset);

        if total_offset >= BANK_SIZE {
            // Calculate bank crossing
            let new_bank = base_bank + (total_offset / BANK_SIZE);
            let new_addr = total_offset % BANK_SIZE;
            warn!("  Bank overflow detected! Crossing from bank {} to {}", base_bank, new_bank);
            debug!("  New address: bank={}, offset={}", new_bank, new_addr);
            // Update bank info accordingly
        }
    } else {
        debug!("  Dynamic offset - generating runtime bank calculation");
        // Dynamic offset - need runtime calculation
        // Generate code to:
        // - Calculate total_offset = base + (index * element_size)
        // - new_bank = base_bank + (total_offset >> 12)  // div by 4096
        // - new_addr = total_offset & 0xFFF              // mod 4096
        trace!("  Will generate runtime bank overflow check");
    }

    // 4. Store result with updated bank info
    mgr.set_pointer_bank(result_name, new_bank_info);

    insts
}
```

**Bank overflow formula**:

```
BANK_SIZE = 4096 instructions = 16384 bytes
new_bank = base_bank + (total_offset / BANK_SIZE)
new_addr = total_offset % BANK_SIZE
```

**Testing requirements**:

- Test array access within single bank
- Test array access crossing bank boundary
- Test nested GEP operations
- Test with both static and dynamic indices

## Phase 2: Arithmetic & Control Flow (Week 2)

### Task 2.1: Complete Binary Operations ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Files created**:

- `rcc-ir/src/v2/instr/binary/mod.rs` - Module structure
- `rcc-ir/src/v2/instr/binary/lowering.rs` - Main lowering logic with Sethi-Ullman ordering
- `rcc-ir/src/v2/instr/binary/arithmetic.rs` - Arithmetic operations (Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Mod, And, Or, Xor, Shift)
- `rcc-ir/src/v2/instr/binary/comparison.rs` - Comparison operations (Eq, Ne, Lt, Le, Gt, Ge, both signed and unsigned)
- `rcc-ir/src/v2/instr/binary/helpers.rs` - Helper functions for register allocation

**Implementation completed**:

- ‚úÖ All arithmetic operations (Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Mod)
- ‚úÖ All logical operations (And, Or, Xor)
- ‚úÖ All shift operations (Shl, LShr, AShr)
- ‚úÖ All comparison operations (Eq, Ne, Slt, Sle, Sgt, Sge, Ult, Ule, Ugt, Uge)
- ‚úÖ Sethi-Ullman ordering for optimal register usage
- ‚úÖ Immediate value optimizations (AddI, MulI, DivI, ModI)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite (17 tests in `binary_tests.rs`)

### Task 2.2: Implement Comparison Operations ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Note**: Comparison operations were implemented as part of binary operations in `binary/comparison.rs`

All comparison predicates are fully implemented:

- Equality (Eq, Ne) using XOR and SLTU
- Signed comparisons (Slt, Sle, Sgt, Sge) using SLT
- Unsigned comparisons (Ult, Ule, Ugt, Uge) using SLTU

### Task 2.3: Implement Branch Instructions ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**File created**: `rcc-ir/src/v2/instr/branch.rs`

**Implementation completed**:

- ‚úÖ Unconditional branches using BEQ R0, R0, label
- ‚úÖ Conditional branches with BEQ/BNE/BLT/BGE
- ‚úÖ Comparison-based branching patterns
- ‚úÖ Support for all comparison types (Eq, Ne, Lt, Le, Gt, Ge)
- ‚úÖ Proper label generation and relative addressing
- ‚úÖ 18 unit tests for branch patterns

**Key design decisions**:

- Use BEQ R0, R0, label for unconditional branches (always true since R0 == R0)
- All branches use relative addressing as required by the VM
- Inverse logic for GT and LE comparisons using swapped operands
- Labels are passed as strings to be resolved by the assembler

## Phase 3: Integration (Week 3)

### Task 3.1: Create V2 Main Lowering Function

**File to create**: `rcc-ir/src/v2/lower.rs`

```rust
use rcc_frontend::ir::{Instruction, Function};
use crate::regmgmt::RegisterPressureManager;
use crate::function::{emit_prologue, emit_epilogue};

pub fn lower_function_v2(func: &Function) -> Vec<AsmInst> {
    let mut insts = vec![];
    let mut mgr = RegisterPressureManager::new(func.locals.len() as i16);

    // 1. Initialize and emit prologue
    mgr.init();  // Initializes R13
    insts.extend(emit_prologue(&mut mgr, func.locals.len()));

    // 2. Process each basic block
    for block in &func.blocks {
        // Analyze block for lifetime info (optional optimization)
        mgr.analyze_block(block);

        // 3. Lower each instruction
        for inst in &block.instructions {
            let inst_asm = lower_instruction(&mut mgr, inst);
            insts.extend(mgr.take_instructions());
            insts.extend(inst_asm);
        }
    }

    // 4. Emit epilogue
    insts.extend(emit_epilogue(&mut mgr));

    insts
}

fn lower_instruction(
    mgr: &mut RegisterPressureManager,
    inst: &Instruction,
) -> Vec<AsmInst> {
    match inst {
        Instruction::Load { .. } => lower_load(mgr, ...),
        Instruction::Store { .. } => lower_store(mgr, ...),
        Instruction::GetElementPtr { .. } => lower_gep(mgr, ...),
        Instruction::BinaryOp { .. } => mgr.emit_binary_op(...),
        Instruction::Icmp { .. } => lower_icmp(mgr, ...),
        Instruction::Call { .. } => lower_call(mgr, ...),
        Instruction::Ret { .. } => lower_return(mgr, ...),
        Instruction::Br { .. } => lower_branch(mgr, ...),
        Instruction::Alloca { .. } => lower_alloca(mgr, ...),
        _ => vec![],
    }
}
```

### Task 3.2: Switch Main Pipeline to V2

**File to modify**: `rcc-ir/src/lower/mod.rs`

```rust
// Add feature flag or configuration
pub fn lower_module(module: &Module, use_v2: bool) -> Vec<AsmInst> {
    if use_v2 {
        // Use V2 backend
        v2::lower::lower_module_v2(module)
    } else {
        // Keep V1 for comparison/fallback
        lower_module_v1(module)
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Week 4)

### Task 4.1: Unit Tests for Each Instruction Type

Create test files:

- `rcc-ir/src/v2/tests/load_store_tests.rs`
- `rcc-ir/src/v2/tests/gep_tests.rs`
- `rcc-ir/src/v2/tests/binary_ops_tests.rs`
- `rcc-ir/src/v2/tests/control_flow_tests.rs`

### Task 4.2: Integration Tests

**Test progression**:

1. Start with simplest tests from `c-test/tests/`:

   - `test_return_42.c` - Just return a constant
   - `test_add.c` - Simple arithmetic
   - `test_local_var.c` - Local variable access

2. Progress to more complex:

   - `test_array.c` - Array access (tests GEP)
   - `test_pointer.c` - Pointer operations
   - `test_function_call.c` - Function calls

3. Run full test suite:

```bash
python3 c-test/run_tests.py --verbose
```

### Task 4.3: Performance Comparison

Compare V1 vs V2:

- Register usage efficiency
- Number of spills
- Code size
- Execution speed in RVM

## Implementation Checklist

### Week 0: Preparation

- [x] Migrate project to 32 registers architecture, described in `/docs/32-REGISTER-UPGRADE.md`
  - [x] Register allocations updated (A0-A3 for args, RV0-RV1 for returns, S0-S3 callee-saved)
  - [x] Calling convention updated to use A0-A3 for first 4 arguments
  - [x] Parameter type tracking for correct fat pointer handling
  - [x] Callee-saved registers (S0-S3) properly preserved
  - [x] Comprehensive tests for all register combinations

- [ ] Basic integration tests pass

### Week 4: Validation

- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Simple C programs compile
- [ ] Complex C programs compile
- [ ] Full test suite passes
- [ ] Performance metrics collected

## Critical Success Factors

### Must Have

1. **R13 always initialized** - RegisterPressureManager handles this
2. **Correct bank registers** - R0 for global, R13 for stack
3. **Bank overflow handling** - GEP must handle crossing banks
4. **Fat pointer support** - Load/store both address and bank
5. **Stack-based parameters** - No parameters in R3-R4

### Should Have

1. **Sethi-Ullman ordering** - Already in RegisterPressureManager
2. **LRU spilling** - Already implemented
3. **Clean error handling** - Proper error messages
4. **Debug information** - Source location tracking

### Nice to Have

1. **Optimization passes** - Dead code elimination
2. **Advanced register allocation** - Graph coloring
3. **Peephole optimization** - Pattern-based improvements

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå DON'T

- Don't forget to use RegisterPressureManager.init()
- Don't manually manage R13 - let the manager handle it
- Don't use R3-R4 for parameters
- Don't ignore bank overflow in GEP
- Don't forget to test fat pointer operations

### ‚úÖ DO

- Always use the RegisterPressureManager API
- Test with both small and large offsets
- Verify bank calculations with concrete examples
- Run tests after each component implementation
- Keep V1 as fallback during development

## Debugging Guide

### Using Logging Effectively

1. **Enable logging during development**:

```bash
# See all V2 decisions
RUST_LOG=rcc_ir::v2=debug cargo test

# Trace register allocation
RUST_LOG=rcc_ir::regmgmt=trace cargo test specific_test

# Debug specific module
RUST_LOG=rcc_ir::instr::load=trace cargo run
```

2. **Add temporary trace points**:

```rust
// When debugging a specific issue
trace!("=== DEBUGGING: Before spill, registers: {:?} ===", self.reg_contents);
// Fix the issue
// Remove or downgrade to trace! once fixed
```

3. **Use structured logging**:

```rust
// Good: Structured, searchable
debug!("GEP calculation: base_bank={}, offset={}, new_bank={}, new_addr={}",
       base_bank, offset, new_bank, new_addr);

// Bad: Unstructured
debug!("Doing GEP stuff");
```

### When things go wrong:

1. **Check R13 initialization**:

   - Look for `LI R13, 1` in generated assembly
   - Must appear before ANY stack operation

2. **Verify bank registers**:

   - Global access should use R0
   - Stack access should use R13
   - Check with `rvm --verbose` to see actual banks used

3. **Trace pointer operations**:

   - Fat pointers need TWO registers (addr + bank)
   - GEP must update BOTH components
   - Check bank overflow calculations

4. **Debug with small examples**:
   ```c
   // Minimal test case
   int main() {
       int x = 42;
       return x;
   }
   ```
5. **Use debug flags**:
   ```bash
   rcc compile test.c --debug 3
   RUST_LOG=trace cargo run
   ```

## Architecture

The test runner is organized into modular components:

### Core Modules

- **`config`**: Test configuration and JSON handling
- **`command`**: Process execution with timeout support
- **`compiler`**: C to binary compilation pipeline
- **`runner`**: Test execution engine with parallel support
- **`reporter`**: Output formatting and progress reporting
- **`cli`**: Command-line interface and argument parsing

### Execution Flow

1. **Load Configuration**: Read tests from `tests.json`
2. **Build Runtime**: Compile runtime library with specified bank size
3. **Compile Tests**: C ‚Üí Assembly ‚Üí Object ‚Üí Binary/Brainfuck
4. **Execute Tests**: Run with timeout and capture output
5. **Compare Results**: Check output against expected values
6. **Report Results**: Display colored output with diffs

## Test Configuration

Tests are defined in `tests.json`:

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "file": "tests/test_hello.c",
      "expected": "Hello World\n",
      "use_runtime": true,
      "description": "Basic hello world test"
    }
  ],
  "known_failures": [
    {
      "file": "tests-known-failures/unsupported.c",
      "description": "Feature not yet implemented"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance

- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel by default using Rayon
- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time progress bars for long test suites
- **Efficient Cleanup**: Automatic artifact cleanup to save disk space
- **Caching**: Runtime library is built once per session

## Error Handling

- **Timeout Detection**: Tests that run too long are terminated
- **Compilation Errors**: Clear error messages for build failures
- **Output Mismatches**: Detailed diffs showing exact differences
- **Provenance Warnings**: Special handling for pointer provenance issues

## Comparison with Python Runner

# Trace Files in rcc-test

The Ripple C test runner (`rct`) now automatically generates compiler trace files for every test compilation. These files provide detailed visibility into each stage of the compilation process.

## Automatic Trace Generation

When running tests with `rct`, the compiler is invoked with the `--trace` flag, which generates the following JSON files in the `c-test/build/` directory:

- `test_name.pp.tokens.json` - Lexer output (tokenized source)
- `test_name.pp.ast.json` - Parser output (Abstract Syntax Tree)
- `test_name.pp.sem.json` - Semantic analyzer output
- `test_name.pp.tast.json` - Typed AST (with resolved types)
- `test_name.pp.ir.json` - Intermediate Representation

Note: The `.pp` in the filename indicates these are generated from the preprocessed C file.

## Usage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run a single test - trace files are generated automatically
./rct test_add

# Run with --no-cleanup to preserve all artifacts including trace files
./rct test_add --no-cleanup

# Run multiple tests
./rct test_add test_pointer
```

### Using the TUI

```bash
# Launch the TUI - trace files are generated for each test run
./rct tui

# In the TUI, press Enter on any test to run it
# Trace files will be saved in c-test/build/
```

## File Locations

All trace files are saved in the `c-test/build/` directory alongside other compilation artifacts:

- `.pp.c` - Preprocessed C source
- `.asm` - Generated assembly
- `.ir` - IR in text format
- `.pobj` - Assembled object file
- `.bin` - Final binary (RVM format)
- `.pp.*.json` - Trace JSON files

## Analyzing Trace Files

The JSON files can be used for:

- Debugging compilation issues
- Understanding how the compiler transforms code
- Building visualization tools
- Teaching compiler internals

Example of viewing a trace file:

```bash
# Pretty-print a trace file
jq '.' c-test/build/test_add.pp.tokens.json | head -20

# Check the AST structure
jq '.items[0].Function.name' c-test/build/test_add.pp.ast.json

# View typed AST with resolved types
jq '.items[0].Function.body' c-test/build/test_add.pp.tast.json
```

## Cleanup

By default, test artifacts are cleaned up after successful test runs. To preserve trace files:

1. Use the `--no-cleanup` flag when running tests
2. Or manually copy trace files before they're deleted
3. Failed tests automatically preserve all artifacts for debugging

## Implementation Details

The trace functionality is implemented by:

1. The `rcc` compiler's `--trace` flag (added to rcc-driver)
2. Automatic inclusion of `--trace` in `rcc-test/src/compiler.rs`
3. Trace files are generated for both CLI and TUI test runners

This provides complete visibility into the compilation pipeline without requiring manual intervention.

Shows comprehensive information about the selected test:

- File path
- Whether it uses runtime
- Description (if available)
- Expected output
- Test results (if run)
- Actual output and execution time

## Architecture

The TUI is built with:

- **ratatui** - Terminal UI framework
- **crossterm** - Cross-platform terminal manipulation

The code is organized into modular components:

- `app.rs` - Application state and data management
- `ui.rs` - UI rendering and layout
- `event.rs` - Event handling system
- `runner.rs` - Test execution and TUI lifecycle

## Implementation Notes

1. **Build Directory Integration**: The TUI reads `.asm` and `.ir` files directly from the build directory after compilation
2. **Real-time Updates**: Test output is captured and displayed in real-time
3. **State Preservation**: Test results are cached during the session
4. **Modular Design**: Each component (test list, code viewer, output) is independently rendered

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:

- Parallel test execution with progress bars
- Test history and statistics
- Diff view for expected vs actual output
- Syntax highlighting for code views
- Export test results to file
- Watchdog mode for continuous testing

# C Test Suite for Ripple C Compiler

This directory contains the test suite for the Ripple C compiler (rcc), which compiles C99 code to Brainfuck.

## Directory Structure

```
c-test/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                    # Main test cases that should pass
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests-known-failures/     # Tests expected to fail (unsupported features)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build/                    # Temporary build artifacts (auto-created)
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
rct

# Run specific tests (without .c extension)
rct test_add test_bool

# Run with different backend (default is rvm)
rct --backend bf

# Run with verbose output
rct -v

# Run with custom timeout (default is 2 seconds)
rct --timeout 5

# Keep build artifacts for debugging
rct --no-cleanup

# Run tests sequentially instead of in parallel
rct --no-parallel

# Debug mode (RVM with -t flag)
rct -d
```

## Adding a New Test

### 1. Create a Test File

Create a `.c` file in the appropriate directory:

- `tests/`

### 2. Write Test Code

Tests should output predictable text that can be verified. Use `putchar()` for output:

```c
// tests/test_example.c
void putchar(int c);

int main() {
    if (2 + 2 == 4) {
        putchar('Y');  // Yes, test passed
    } else {
        putchar('N');  // No, test failed
    }
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Add Test to Suite

```bash
# Add a test with expected output
rct add tests/test_example.c "Y\n"

# Add a test with description
rct add tests/test_example.c "Y\n" -d "Tests basic arithmetic"

# Add a test that doesn't use runtime
rct add tests/test_standalone.c "42" --no-runtime
```

### 4. Run Your Test

```bash
# Run a specific test
rct test_example

# Run multiple tests
rct test_example test_arithmetic

# Run all tests matching a pattern
rct run -f "test_*"
```

## Test Guidelines

1. **Keep tests focused** - Test one feature at a time
2. **Use assertions** - Output 'Y' for pass, 'N' for fail conditions
3. **Include newlines** - End output with `\n` for clean formatting

## Prerequisites

Before running tests, ensure you have:

```bash
# Build the C compiler and tools
cd .. && cargo build --release

# Launch interactive TUI for test management
rct tui
```

## Understanding Test Output

- ‚úì Green: Test passed
- ‚úó Red: Test failed
- ‚úì Yellow: Test passed with warnings (e.g., pointer provenance issues)
- Known failures: Tests in `tests-known-failures/` are expected to fail

## Debugging Failed Tests

Use `--no-cleanup` to keep intermediate files:

```bash
rct --no-cleanup test_example
```

This preserves in `build/`:

- `.asm` - Generated assembly
- `.pobj` - Assembled object files
- `.bin` - Final binary (RVM backend)
- `.bfm` - Linked Brainfuck macro output (BF backend)
- `_expanded.bf` - Expanded macro code (BF backend)
- `.disassembly.asm` - Disassembled binary (for debugging)

You can then manually inspect or run individual compilation steps.

# V2 Backend Architecture

## Design Principles

The V2 backend follows strict encapsulation to ensure safety and prevent misuse:

1. **Make illegal states unrepresentable**
2. **Hide implementation complexity**
3. **No escape hatches to internals**
4. **If users need something, add a safe method**

## Module Structure

‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                # Integration tests
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integration_tests.rs  # Tests using ONLY public APIs
```

## Public API

Users of the V2 backend should ONLY use:

- `FunctionBuilder` - Safe function generation
- `CallArg` - Argument types for calls
- `RegisterPressureManager` - Register allocation (if needed directly)
- `lower_load/lower_store` - Instruction lowering
- `NameGenerator` - Unique naming

## Example Usage

```rust
use rcc_ir::{FunctionBuilder, CallArg};

let mut builder = FunctionBuilder::new();

builder.begin_function(10);  // 10 local slots

let param = builder.load_parameter(0);

// Make a call - ALL complexity handled automatically
let (result, _) = builder.call_function(
    0x200,  // address
    2,      // bank
    vec![CallArg::Scalar(param)],
    false   // returns scalar
);

builder.end_function(Some((result, None)));

let instructions = builder.build();
```

## Safety Guarantees

The FunctionBuilder API prevents:

- Emitting epilogue before prologue
- Forgetting stack cleanup after calls
- Accessing locals before prologue
- Mismatched call/cleanup sequences
- Breaking internal invariants

## Testing Strategy

- **Internal tests** (function/tests/, regmgmt/tests/): Test implementation details
- **Integration tests** (tests/integration_tests.rs): Test through public API only
- No test should import internal modules unless it's in the module's own test directory

# Register Management Module

## Overview

This module provides the encapsulated register management system for the V2 backend. It ensures safe, automatic handling of register allocation, spilling, and bank management.

## Architecture

```
regmgmt/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mod.rs           # Public API exports
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pressure.rs      # RegisterPressureManager (main public interface)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ allocator.rs     # RegAllocV2 (internal, not exposed except for tests)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bank.rs          # BankInfo enum for pointer bank management
```

## Key Features

### Automatic R13 Initialization

- R13 (stack bank register) is automatically initialized to 1 when needed
- No manual flag management required
- Prevents common bugs from forgetting initialization

### LRU Spilling

- Implements Least Recently Used spilling policy
- Automatic spill/reload generation
- Optimal register usage with Sethi-Ullman ordering

### Bank Management

- Tracks bank information for all pointers
- Supports Global (bank 0), Stack (bank 1), and Dynamic banks
- Ensures correct bank register usage in memory operations

## Public API

### RegisterPressureManager

The main interface for register management:

```rust
// Core allocation
pub fn new(local_count: i16) -> Self
pub fn init(&mut self)
pub fn get_register(&mut self, for_value: String) -> Reg
pub fn free_register(&mut self, reg: Reg)
pub fn take_instructions(&mut self) -> Vec<AsmInst>

// Spilling
pub fn spill_all(&mut self)
pub fn reload_value(&mut self, value: String) -> Reg
pub fn get_spill_count(&self) -> usize

// Special operations
pub fn load_parameter(&mut self, param_idx: usize) -> Reg
pub fn set_pointer_bank(&mut self, ptr_value: String, bank: BankInfo)

// Binary operations (with Sethi-Ullman ordering)
pub fn emit_binary_op(&mut self, op: IrBinaryOp, lhs: &Value, rhs: &Value, result_temp: TempId) -> Vec<AsmInst>

// Lifetime analysis (for optimization)
pub fn analyze_block(&mut self, block: &BasicBlock)
```

### BankInfo

Represents bank information for pointers:

```rust
pub enum BankInfo {
    Global,           // Bank 0 - use R0
    Stack,            // Bank 1 - use R13 (auto-initialized)
    Register(Reg),    // Dynamic bank in a register
}
```

## Usage Example

```rust
use crate::regmgmt::{RegisterPressureManager, BankInfo};

// Create manager with 10 local variables
let mut manager = RegisterPressureManager::new(10);
manager.init();  // Initializes R13 automatically

// Allocate registers
let r1 = manager.get_register("temp1".to_string());
let r2 = manager.get_register("temp2".to_string());

// Set pointer bank info
manager.set_pointer_bank("ptr1".to_string(), BankInfo::Stack);

// Spill all registers before a call
manager.spill_all();

// Take generated instructions
let instructions = manager.take_instructions();
```

## Safety Invariants

1. **Sb Initialization**: Stack Bank always initialized before any stack operation
2. **Register Consistency**: Register contents always match internal tracking
3. **Spill Slot Management**: Each value has at most one spill slot
4. **Bank Tracking**: All pointers have associated bank information
5. **LRU Ordering**: Most recently used registers are kept in registers

## Implementation Notes

- RegAllocV2 is completely encapsulated and not exposed in the public API
- All register management must go through RegisterPressureManager
- The module design prevents direct manipulation of internal state

# C Test Suite for Ripple C Compiler

This directory contains the test suite for the Ripple C compiler (rcc), which compiles C99 code to Brainfuck.

## Directory Structure

```
c-test/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                    # Main test cases that should pass
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests-known-failures/     # Tests expected to fail (unsupported features)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build/                    # Temporary build artifacts (auto-created)
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
rct

# Run specific tests (without .c extension)
rct test_add test_bool

# Run with different backend (default is rvm)
rct --backend bf

# Run with verbose output
rct -v

# Run with custom timeout (default is 2 seconds)
rct --timeout 5

# Keep build artifacts for debugging
rct --no-cleanup

# Run tests sequentially instead of in parallel
rct --no-parallel

# Debug mode (RVM with -t flag)
rct -d
```

## Adding a New Test

### 1. Create a Test File

Create a `.c` file in the appropriate directory:

- `tests/`

### 2. Write Test Code

Tests should output predictable text that can be verified. Use `putchar()` for output:

```c
// tests/test_example.c
void putchar(int c);

int main() {
    if (2 + 2 == 4) {
        putchar('Y');  // Yes, test passed
    } else {
        putchar('N');  // No, test failed
    }
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Add Test to Suite

```bash
# Add a test with expected output
rct add tests/test_example.c "Y\n"

# Add a test with description
rct add tests/test_example.c "Y\n" -d "Tests basic arithmetic"

# Add a test that doesn't use runtime
rct add tests/test_standalone.c "42" --no-runtime
```

### 4. Run Your Test

```bash
# Run a specific test
rct test_example

# Run multiple tests
rct test_example test_arithmetic

# Run all tests matching a pattern
rct run -f "test_*"
```

## Test Guidelines

1. **Keep tests focused** - Test one feature at a time
2. **Use assertions** - Output 'Y' for pass, 'N' for fail conditions
3. **Include newlines** - End output with `\n` for clean formatting

## Prerequisites

Before running tests, ensure you have:

```bash
# Build the C compiler and tools
cd .. && cargo build --release

# Build the assembler
cd ../src/ripple-asm && cargo build --release && cd ..

# Build rbt tool
cd ../rbt && cargo build --release && cd ..


# Install required tools
brew install coreutils  # for gtimeout
npm install -g @ahineya/bfm bf  # Brainfuck tools
```

## Additional Commands

```bash
# List all available tests
rct list

# List only test names
rct list --names-only

# Include known failures in listing
rct list --include-failures

# Check for test files not added to suite
rct check

# Show test suite statistics
rct stats

# Clean build directory
rct clean

# Build runtime library
rct build-runtime

# Debug a single test interactively
rct debug test_example

# Rename a test (updates both .c and .meta.json)
rct rename old_test new_test

# Launch interactive TUI for test management
rct tui
```

## Understanding Test Output

- ‚úì Green: Test passed
- ‚úó Red: Test failed
- ‚úì Yellow: Test passed with warnings (e.g., pointer provenance issues)
- Known failures: Tests in `tests-known-failures/` are expected to fail

## Debugging Failed Tests

Use `--no-cleanup` to keep intermediate files:

```bash
rct --no-cleanup test_example
```

This preserves in `build/`:

- `.asm` - Generated assembly
- `.pobj` - Assembled object files
- `.bin` - Final binary (RVM backend)
- `.bfm` - Linked Brainfuck macro output (BF backend)
- `_expanded.bf` - Expanded macro code (BF backend)
- `.disassembly.asm` - Disassembled binary (for debugging)

You can then manually inspect or run individual compilation steps.

# Brainfuck WASM Module

This Rust Brainfuck interpreter can be compiled to WebAssembly for use in web browsers.

## Features

- Multiple cell sizes (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit)
- Configurable tape size
- Cell value wrapping
- Tape pointer wrapping
- Code optimization (Clear, Set, MulAdd, Scan patterns)
- Returns full tape state and pointer position after execution

## Building the WASM Module

```bash
# Install wasm-pack if not already installed
cargo install wasm-pack

# Build the WASM module
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg --no-opt

# Or use the build script
./build-wasm.sh
```

## Using in JavaScript

```javascript
import init, { BrainfuckInterpreter } from "./pkg/bf_wasm.js";

// Initialize the WASM module
await init();

// Create an interpreter with default options
const interpreter = new BrainfuckInterpreter();

// Or with custom options
const interpreter = BrainfuckInterpreter.with_options(
  30000, // tape_size
  8, // cell_size (8, 16, or 32)
  true, // wrap (cell values)
  true, // wrap_tape (pointer wrapping)
  true // optimize (enable optimizations)
);

// Run a Brainfuck program
const code =
  "++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.";
const input = new Uint8Array([]); // Optional input
const result = interpreter.run_program(code, input);

// Result contains:
// - tape: Array of cell values (as u32)
// - pointer: Current pointer position
// - output: String output from the program

console.log("Output:", result.output);
console.log("Pointer:", result.pointer);
console.log("Tape:", result.tape);
```

## Testing

Open `test-wasm.html` in a web browser using a local web server:

```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Node.js
npx http-server -p 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000/test-wasm.html
```

## API Reference

### `BrainfuckInterpreter`

#### Constructor

- `new()` - Create interpreter with default settings
- `with_options(tape_size, cell_size, wrap, wrap_tape, optimize)` - Create with custom settings

#### Methods

- `run_program(code, input)` - Execute Brainfuck code with optional input
  - Returns: `{ tape: number[], pointer: number, output: string }`
- `run_program_with_callback(code, input, outputCallback)` - Execute with real-time output callback
  - `outputCallback(char: string, charCode: number)` - Called for each output character
  - Returns: `{ tape: number[], pointer: number, output: string }`
- `optimize_brainfuck(code)` - Optimize and return Brainfuck code
  - Returns: Optimized Brainfuck string

## Real-time Output Example

```javascript
// Create output callback for real-time display
const outputCallback = (char, charCode) => {
  // char is the character as a string
  // charCode is the ASCII value
  if (charCode === 10) {
    console.log(); // newline
  } else {
    process.stdout.write(char);
  }
};

// Run with callback
const result = interpreter.run_program_with_callback(
  code,
  inputBytes,
  outputCallback
);
```

This allows you to capture output as it's generated, perfect for:

- Live streaming output to the UI
- Building interactive debuggers
- Creating progress indicators for long-running programs
- Implementing output filters or transformations

## Command Line Usage

The interpreter can still be used as a command-line tool:

```bash
# Build the CLI binary
cargo build --release

# Run a Brainfuck program
./target/release/bf program.bf

# With options
./target/release/bf program.bf --cell-size 16 --tape-size 50000 --no-wrap

# Show optimized code
./target/release/bf program.bf --emit-optimized

# Disable optimizations
./target/release/bf program.bf --no-optimize
```

# Rust Macro Expander Implementation Status

## Working Features ‚úÖ

- Basic macro definitions and invocations
- Parameter substitution
- Builtin function `{repeat(n, content)}`
- Builtin function `{if(cond, true_branch, false_branch)}`
- Multiline macros with `{}` syntax
- Single-line macros with backslash continuation
- `#` and `@` as equivalent macro invocation prefixes
- Comment handling
- Source map generation
- Circular dependency detection
- CLI tool with expand, list, and validate commands
- WASM bindings

## Key Fix Applied

The TypeScript lexer treats builtin functions like `{repeat`, `{if`, `{for`, `{reverse` as single tokens. This was critical for proper parsing. The Rust implementation now does the same.

## Partially Working/Needs Testing üîß

- `{for(var in array, body)}` loops - implementation exists but some tests failing
- `{reverse(array)}` function - implementation exists but some tests failing
- Tuple destructuring in for loops
- Nested arrays in for loops

## Files Structure

- `src/lib.rs` - Main library interface
- `src/lexer.rs` - Tokenizer (now correctly handles `{repeat` as single token)
- `src/parser.rs` - Parser implementation
- `src/ast.rs` - AST node definitions
- `src/expander.rs` - Main expansion logic
- `src/expander_helpers.rs` - Builtin function expansion
- `src/expander_utils.rs` - Utility functions
- `src/types.rs` - Type definitions
- `src/source_map.rs` - Source map generation
- `src/main.rs` - CLI implementation
- `src/wasm.rs` - WASM bindings

## Known Issues

- Some advanced for loop tests failing
- Array/tuple destructuring tests failing

### Debug Mode Commands

When running with `-d` (simple debugger), the following commands are available:

- **Enter** - Step one instruction
- **r** - Run to completion
- **c** - Continue from breakpoint (after BRK)
- **q** - Quit debugger

## TUI Debugger Mode (-t)

The TUI (Terminal User Interface) debugger provides a professional debugging environment with multiple synchronized panes and advanced features.

### Launch

```bash
rvm -t program.bin
```

### Interface Layout

The TUI debugger displays 6 panes simultaneously:

1. **Disassembly** (F1) - Shows instructions with addresses, breakpoints, and current PC
2. **Registers** (F2) - All 18 registers with change highlighting
3. **Memory** (F3) - Hex and ASCII view with editing capabilities
4. **Stack** (F4) - Return address tracking
5. **Watches** (F5) - Named memory locations for monitoring
6. **Output** (F6) - Program output buffer

### Navigation

- **F1-F6** - Switch directly to specific pane
- **Tab** - Cycle through panes forward
- **Shift+Tab** - Cycle through panes backward
- **h/j/k/l** - Vim-style navigation within panes
- **‚Üë/‚Üì/‚Üê/‚Üí** - Arrow key navigation
- **PageUp/PageDown** - Scroll by page in current pane

### Execution Control

- **Space/s** - Step single instruction
- **r** - Run until breakpoint or halt
- **c** - Continue from current breakpoint
- **R** - Restart execution from beginning (preserves program)

### Breakpoints

- **b** - Toggle breakpoint at cursor position
- **Shift+B** - Set/toggle breakpoint by instruction number
  - Enter instruction number (e.g., "5" for instruction #5)
  - Or hex address (e.g., "0x100")
- **B** - Clear all breakpoints

### Memory Operations

- **g** - Go to memory address (enter hex address)
- **a** - Toggle ASCII display in memory pane
- **e** - Edit memory with multiple formats:
  - `addr:0xFF` - Hexadecimal value
  - `addr:255` - Decimal value
  - `addr:'A'` - Single character
  - `addr:"Hello"` - String (writes multiple bytes)
  - `addr:0b1010` - Binary value
- **0-9,a-f** - Quick hex edit at cursor (Memory pane only)
- **w** - Add memory watch (format: `name:address[:format]`)
- **W** - Remove selected watch

### Command Mode (:)

Press `:` to enter command mode for advanced operations:

- `:break <addr>` - Set breakpoint at address
- `:delete <addr>` - Remove breakpoint at address
- `:watch <name> <addr>` - Add named memory watch
- `:mem <addr> <value>` - Write value to memory
- `:reg <#> <value>` - Set register value
- `:help` - Show help
- `:quit` or `:q` - Exit debugger

### Other Keys

- **?** - Toggle help overlay
- **q** - Quit debugger (also available in command mode)
- **ESC** - Cancel current input/mode

### Visual Indicators

- **Breakpoints** - Red `‚óè` markers in disassembly
- **Current PC** - Yellow highlighted line with `‚ñ∫` marker
- **Register changes** - Yellow highlighting for recently modified registers
- **Non-zero values** - White text for non-zero memory/registers
- **I/O registers** - Magenta highlighting for addresses 0x0000-0x0001
- **Active pane** - Cyan border and "ACTIVE" label

### Memory Display Features

- 16 bytes per row in hexadecimal
- Optional ASCII representation (toggle with 'a')
- Color coding for special addresses and non-zero values
- Continuous scrolling through entire memory space

### Tips

- Use Shift+B to quickly set breakpoints at specific instructions
- Memory edits support various formats for convenience
- Command history available with ‚Üë/‚Üì in command mode
- All numeric inputs accept hex (0x prefix) or decimal

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

The test suite includes:

- `test_hello` - Basic I/O and HALT
- `test_arithmetic` - ADD, MUL, and loops
- `test_bitwise` - AND, OR, XOR, shifts
- `test_comparison` - SLT, SLTU, BLT, BGE
- `test_division` - DIV, MOD and immediate versions
- `test_jumps` - CALL/RET (JAL/JALR)
- `test_memory` - LOAD/STORE operations

## Architecture

The VM implements the Ripple architecture as specified in `docs/ASSEMBLY_FORMAT.md`:

### Registers

- R0: Always reads as 0
- PC: Program counter (offset within bank)
- PCB: Program counter bank
- RA: Return address (low)
- RAB: Return address bank (high)
- R3-R15: General purpose

### Memory

- 64KB address space (65536 16-bit cells)
- Memory-mapped I/O:
  - 0x0000: Output register (write byte to stdout)
  - 0x0001: Output ready flag

### Instruction Set

All opcodes from 0x00 to 0x1F are implemented, including:

- ALU operations (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, SLL, SRL, SLT, SLTU)
- Immediate operations (ADDI, ANDI, ORI, XORI, LI, SLLI, SRLI)
- Memory operations (LOAD, STORE)
- Control flow (JAL, JALR, BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE)
- Extended arithmetic (MUL, DIV, MOD and immediate versions)
- Special (NOP, HALT, BRK)

### BRK Instruction Behavior

The BRK (breakpoint) instruction behaves differently depending on the execution mode:

#### Normal Mode (without -d flag)

- Dumps complete VM state to stderr including:
  - All register values (hex and decimal)
  - First 32 words of memory
  - Current instruction details
- **Halts execution immediately**
- Useful for debugging crashes and inspecting state

#### Debug Mode (with -d flag)

- Prints breakpoint notification
- **Pauses execution** without halting
- Allows continuing with 'c' command or single-stepping
- Acts as a traditional debugger breakpoint

## Program Format

The VM loads binary programs in RLINK format:

- Magic: "RLINK" (5 bytes)
- Entry point (4 bytes, little-endian)
- Instruction count (4 bytes, little-endian)
- Instructions (8 bytes each)
- Data size (4 bytes, little-endian)
- Data section (variable length)

R5 == 0x48 - Register equals value
R0 != R1 - Register not equals register
R13 < 0x10 - Less than
R13 > 0x10 - Greater than
R13 <= 0x10 - Less than or equal
R13 >= 0x10 - Greater than or equal
[0x1000] == 42 - Memory at address equals value
[R5+R6] != 0 - Memory at computed address
changed(R5) - Register value changed since last instruction
R5 & 0xFF == 0x48 - Bitwise AND
R0 + R1 > 0x100 - Arithmetic expressions
PC == 0x100 && R0 != 0 - AND multiple conditions
R5 == 0x48 && R6 == 0x65 - Chain conditions
RA == 0 && PC > 0x2000 - Complex combinations

# Ripple VM Memory-Mapped I/O Documentation

## Overview

The Ripple VM implements a memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) system with a dedicated 32-word header at bank 0, addresses 0-31. This provides efficient access to I/O devices, random number generation, and display control without requiring system calls or special instructions.

## Memory Layout

### MMIO Header (Bank 0, Words 0-31)

| Address | Name                  | R/W | Description                                           |
| ------- | --------------------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 0       | `HDR_TTY_OUT`         | W   | TTY output (low 8 bits written to stdout)             |
| 1       | `HDR_TTY_STATUS`      | R   | TTY status (bit 0: ready flag)                        |

### TEXT40 VRAM (Bank 0, Words 32-1031)

- **Location**: Words 32-1031 (1000 words total)
- **Layout**: 40x25 character cells
- **Format**: Each word contains: `(attribute << 8) | ascii_char`
  - Low byte: ASCII character code
  - High byte: Attributes: bg and fg color, each 4 bits (16 colors total)

### General Memory (Bank 0, Word 1032+)

Regular data memory starts at word 1032, after the VRAM region.

## Device Details

### TTY I/O

**Output (HDR_TTY_OUT)**

- Write-only register at address 0
- Low 8 bits are sent to stdout immediately
- Sets TTY_STATUS busy flag temporarily (currently instant ready)

**Status (HDR_TTY_STATUS)**

- Read-only register at address 1
- Bit 0: Ready flag (1=ready to accept output, 0=busy)

**Input (HDR_TTY_IN_POP)**

- Read-only register at address 2
- Reading pops one byte from input buffer
- Returns 0 if buffer is empty

**Input Status (HDR_TTY_IN_STATUS)**

- Read-only register at address 3
- Bit 0: Has byte flag (1=byte available, 0=buffer empty)

### Random Number Generator

**RNG (HDR_RNG)**

- Read-only register at address 4
- Each read advances the PRNG state
- Returns a 16-bit pseudorandom value
- Uses Linear Congruential Generator (LCG): `next = (1664525 * prev + 1013904223) mod 2^32`

**RNG Seed (HDR_RNG_SEED)**

- Read/Write register at address 5
- Controls low 16 bits of RNG seed
- Writing sets the seed for reproducible sequences

### Storage Device

**Overview**

- Persistent block storage device with 4 GiB total capacity
- 65,536 blocks √ó 65,536 bytes per block = 4 GiB
- Lazy initialization: blocks are only allocated when accessed
- Backed by `~/.RippleVM/disk.img` sparse file

**Storage Block (HDR_STORE_BLOCK)**

- Write-only register at address 17
- Selects active block number (0-65535)
- All subsequent operations apply to this block

**Storage Address (HDR_STORE_ADDR)**

- Write-only register at address 18
- Selects byte address within current block (0-65535)
- Auto-increments after each HDR_STORE_DATA access
- Wraps to 0 after reaching 65535

**Storage Data (HDR_STORE_DATA)**

- Read/Write register at address 19
- Read: Returns byte at (block, addr) in low 8 bits (high 8 bits are 0)
- Write: Updates byte at (block, addr) using low 8 bits of value (high 8 bits ignored)
- Auto-increments HDR_STORE_ADDR after each operation

**Storage Control (HDR_STORE_CTL)**

- Read/Write register at address 20
- Control bits:
  - Bit 0 (BUSY): Read-only, 1 if VM is processing operation
  - Bit 1 (DIRTY): Read/Write, 1 if current block has uncommitted writes
  - Bit 2 (COMMIT): Write-only, writing 1 commits current block
  - Bit 3 (COMMIT_ALL): Write-only, writing 1 commits all dirty blocks
  - Bits 15-4: Reserved (read as 0)

### Keyboard Input (TEXT40 Mode Only)

**Overview**

- Keyboard input flags are only active when display mode is set to TEXT40
- Keys are polled when reading keyboard MMIO addresses
- Flags indicate momentary key state (1=key event detected, 0=no event)
- State is cleared before each poll, so keys must be held for continuous input

**Arrow Keys (HDR_KEY_UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT)**

- Read-only registers at addresses 10-13
- Bit 0 indicates key state
- Used for navigation in games

**Action Keys (HDR_KEY_Z/X)**

- Read-only registers at addresses 14-15
- Bit 0 indicates key state
- Common game action buttons (e.g., jump, shoot)

### Display System

**Display Mode (HDR_DISP_MODE)**

- Read/Write register at address 6
- Values:
  - 0: Display OFF
  - 1: TTY passthrough mode
  - 2: TEXT40 mode (40x25 character display)
  - 3: RGB565 mode (graphics display)

**Display Status (HDR_DISP_STATUS)**

- Read-only register at address 7
- Bit 0: Ready flag
- Bit 1: Flush done flag

**Display Control (HDR_DISP_CTL)**

- Read/Write register at address 8
- Bit 0: Enable display
- Bit 1: Clear VRAM (edge-triggered, auto-clears)

**Display Flush (HDR_DISP_FLUSH)**

- Write-only register at address 9
- Writing non-zero triggers display update
- Sets flush_done flag when complete
- In RGB565 mode, swaps the front and back framebuffers

**Display Resolution (HDR_DISP_RESOLUTION)**

- Read/Write register at address 16
- Used for RGB565 mode only
- Format: high 8 bits = width, low 8 bits = height
- Must be set BEFORE switching to RGB565 mode
- Maximum resolution depends on bank size: `(bank_size - 32) / 2` pixels total

### RGB565 Graphics Mode

**Overview**

- 16-bit color per pixel (5 bits red, 6 bits green, 5 bits blue)
- Double-buffered for smooth animation
- Resolution configurable up to bank size limits

**Setup Procedure**

1. Set desired resolution at HDR_DISP_RESOLUTION (address 16)
2. Set display mode to 3 (RGB565) at HDR_DISP_MODE (address 6)
3. If resolution doesn't fit in bank, VM will halt

**Memory Layout in RGB565 Mode**

- Words 0-31: MMIO headers (unchanged)
- Words 32 to 32+WxH-1: Front buffer (displayed)
- Words 32+WxH to 32+2xWxH-1: Back buffer (for drawing)

**RGB565 Color Format**

```
Bit:  15 14 13 12 11 | 10 9 8 7 6 5 | 4 3 2 1 0
      R  R  R  R  R  | G  G G G G G | B B B B B
```

**Drawing Workflow**

1. Write pixels to back buffer memory addresses
2. Write non-zero to HDR_DISP_FLUSH to swap buffers
3. Back buffer becomes visible, old front buffer becomes new back buffer

## Implementation Details

### MMIO Read Handling

The VM intercepts reads to bank 0, addresses 0-1031:

1. Addresses 0-31: MMIO header registers
2. Addresses 32-1031: TEXT40 VRAM (direct memory access)
3. Other banks or addresses > 1031: Regular memory access

```rust
fn handle_mmio_read(&mut self, addr: usize) -> Option<u16> {
    match addr {
        HDR_TTY_OUT => Some(0),  // Write-only
        HDR_TTY_STATUS => Some(if self.output_ready { TTY_READY } else { 0 }),
        HDR_TTY_IN_POP => {
            let value = self.input_buffer.pop_front().unwrap_or(0) as u16;
            self.memory[HDR_TTY_IN_POP] = value;
            Some(value)
        },
        HDR_TTY_IN_STATUS => Some(if !self.input_buffer.is_empty() { TTY_HAS_BYTE } else { 0 }),
        HDR_RNG => {
            self.rng_state = self.rng_state.wrapping_mul(1664525).wrapping_add(1013904223);
            let value = (self.rng_state >> 16) as u16;
            self.memory[HDR_RNG] = value;
            Some(value)
        },
        // ... other MMIO addresses
        _ => None  // Not MMIO
    }
}
```

### MMIO Write Handling

The VM intercepts writes to bank 0, addresses 0-1031:

```rust
fn handle_mmio_write(&mut self, addr: usize, value: u16) -> bool {
    match addr {
        HDR_TTY_OUT => {
            let byte = (value & 0xFF) as u8;
            io::stdout().write_all(&[byte]);
            io::stdout().flush();
            self.output_buffer.push_back(byte);
            true
        },
        HDR_DISP_CTL => {
            if value & DISP_CLEAR != 0 {
                // Clear VRAM
                for i in TEXT40_BASE_WORD..=TEXT40_LAST_WORD {
                    self.memory[i] = 0;
                }
            }
            if value & DISP_ENABLE != 0 {
                self.display_enabled = true;
            }
            true
        },
        // ... other MMIO addresses
        _ => false  // Not MMIO
    }
}
```

### Memory Access Instructions

LOAD and STORE instructions check for MMIO addresses:

```rust
// LOAD instruction (opcode 0x11)
if bank_val == 0 && addr_val < TEXT40_LAST_WORD as u16 + 1 {
    if let Some(value) = self.handle_mmio_read(addr_val as usize) {
        self.registers[rd] = value;
    } else {
        self.registers[rd] = self.memory[addr_val as usize];
    }
}

// STORE instruction (opcode 0x12)
if bank_val == 0 && addr_val < TEXT40_LAST_WORD as u16 + 1 {
    if !self.handle_mmio_write(addr_val as usize, value) {
        self.memory[addr_val as usize] = value;
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic TTY Output

```asm
; Print 'A' to stdout
LI    A0, 'A'
LI    T0, 0        ; Bank 0
LI    T1, 0        ; Address 0 (HDR_TTY_OUT)

STORE A0, T0, T1

LI    A0, 'i'
LI    T1, 33       ; VRAM[1]
STORE A0, T0, T1

; Flush display
LI    A0, 1
LI    T1, 9        ; HDR_DISP_FLUSH
STORE A0, T0, T1
```

### Random Number Generation

```asm
; Get random number
LI    T0, 0        ; Bank 0

LI    T0, 0        ; Bank 0
LI    T1, 10       ; HDR_KEY_UP
LOAD  T2, T0, T1
ANDI  T2, T2, 1
BEQ   T2, R0, not_pressed

; Handle up arrow press
; ... game logic ...

not_pressed:
```

### Storage Operations

```asm
; Write data to block 42, starting at byte 0
LI    A0, 42
LI    T0, 0        ; Bank 0
LI    T1, 17       ; HDR_STORE_BLOCK
STORE A0, T0, T1

LI    A0, 0
LI    T1, 18       ; HDR_STORE_ADDR
STORE A0, T0, T1

; Write "Hello" (one byte at a time)
LI    A0, 'H'
LI    T1, 19       ; HDR_STORE_DATA
STORE A0, T0, T1   ; Auto-increments address

LI    A0, 'e'
STORE A0, T0, T1   ; Auto-increments address

LI    A0, 'l'
STORE A0, T0, T1   ; Auto-increments address

LI    A0, 'l'
STORE A0, T0, T1   ; Auto-increments address

LI    A0, 'o'
STORE A0, T0, T1   ; Auto-increments address

; Commit the block to disk
LI    A0, 4        ; Bit 2 = COMMIT
LI    T1, 20       ; HDR_STORE_CTL
STORE A0, T0, T1

; Read back the data
LI    A0, 42
LI    T1, 17       ; HDR_STORE_BLOCK
STORE A0, T0, T1

LI    A0, 0
LI    T1, 18       ; HDR_STORE_ADDR
STORE A0, T0, T1

LI    T1, 19       ; HDR_STORE_DATA
LOAD  A0, T0, T1   ; Read first byte ('H')
LOAD  A1, T0, T1   ; Read second byte ('e') (auto-increment)
LOAD  A2, T0, T1   ; Read third byte ('l') (auto-increment)
LOAD  A3, T0, T1   ; Read fourth byte ('l') (auto-increment)
LOAD  X0, T0, T1   ; Read fifth byte ('o') (auto-increment)
```

## C Runtime Integration

The C runtime library uses these MMIO addresses for standard I/O:

```c
// putchar implementation
void putchar(int c) {
    volatile uint16_t* tty_out = (volatile uint16_t*)0;
    volatile uint16_t* tty_status = (volatile uint16_t*)1;

    // Wait for ready
    while ((*tty_status & 1) == 0) {
        // Spin wait
    }

    // Output character
    *tty_out = c & 0xFF;
}

// getchar implementation
int getchar(void) {
    volatile uint16_t* tty_in_status = (volatile uint16_t*)3;
    volatile uint16_t* tty_in_pop = (volatile uint16_t*)2;

    // Wait for input
    while ((*tty_in_status & 1) == 0) {
        // Spin wait
    }

    // Read and return byte
    return *tty_in_pop & 0xFF;
}
```

## Design Rationale

1. **Fixed Addresses**: All MMIO addresses are fixed at compile time, eliminating runtime discovery overhead
2. **Bank 0 Only**: MMIO is only active in bank 0, simplifying implementation and preventing conflicts
3. **Minimal Header**: 32-word header provides space for current devices plus 22 reserved words for future expansion
4. **Efficient Access**: Low addresses (0-31) are optimal for Brainfuck-generated code
5. **Backward Compatible**: Legacy MMIO_OUT and MMIO_OUT_FLAG aliases maintained at addresses 0 and 1

## Future Enhancements

The reserved MMIO addresses (21-31) are available for future devices such as:

- Timer/counter peripherals
- Additional display modes
- Sound generation
- Network I/O
- Interrupt controllers
- DMA controllers
- Serial communication ports

These can be added without breaking existing code since the header layout is fixed.

# Forth Interpreter Instructions

## How to Run

```bash
./rct run forth_simple
```

## Basic Usage

The Forth interpreter uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). Enter numbers and operators separated by spaces:

```forth
> 5 3 +
 ok
> .
8 ok
```

## Available Commands

### Arithmetic

- `+` - Add top two stack items
- `-` - Subtract (second - top)
- `*` - Multiply top two stack items
- `/` - Divide (second / top)
- `MOD` - Modulo (second % top)

### Comparison (returns -1 for true, 0 for false)

- `=` - Equal
- `<` - Less than
- `>` - Greater than

### Stack Operations

- `DUP` - Duplicate top of stack
- `DROP` - Remove top of stack
- `SWAP` - Swap top two items
- `OVER` - Copy second item to top
- `ROT` - Rotate top three items

### I/O

- `.` - Print and remove top of stack
- `CR` - Print newline
- `EMIT` - Print top of stack as ASCII character
- `.S` - Show entire stack (non-destructive)

### Dictionary

- `WORDS` - List all available words
- `: name ... ;` - Define new word

### System

- `BYE` - Exit interpreter

## Examples

### Basic Math

```forth
> 5 3 + .
8 ok
> 10 4 - .
6 ok
> 6 7 * .
42 ok
```

### Stack Manipulation

```forth
> 1 2 3 .S
Stack:
  1
  2
  3
 ok
> SWAP .S
Stack:
  1
  3
  2
 ok
```

### Define New Words

```forth
> : SQUARE DUP * ;
 ok
> 5 SQUARE .
25 ok

> : DOUBLE 2 * ;
 ok
> 7 DOUBLE .
14 ok
```

### Comparison

```forth
> 5 5 = .
-1 ok
> 3 7 < .
-1 ok
> 10 5 > .
-1 ok
```

## Notes

- The interpreter uses RPN (Reverse Polish Notation)
- All operations work on the stack
- Numbers are pushed onto the stack automatically
- Words (commands) operate on stack values
- Use `.S` to inspect the stack at any time
- Use `WORDS` to see all available commands

Pavlo, here‚Äôs the exact fix path and what to change, step-by-step. This removes the ‚Äú\x01X / \x00X / XX‚Äù drift by making the caller and callee agree on how parameters are placed and read.

What‚Äôs actually broken
‚Ä¢ Your callee loads stack parameters from hard-coded FP - k slots that don‚Äôt match the actual placement for that signature.
‚Ä¢ Your caller and callee must agree on:
‚Ä¢ how many argument register words are used (A0..A3 = 4 words total),
‚Ä¢ which parameters spill to the stack,
‚Ä¢ and, for fat pointers spilled to the stack, the word order (address first, then bank).

Where to fix

1. Callee: compute stack offsets from actual placement

File: calling_convention.rs
Function: impl CallingConvention { pub fn load_param(&self, index: usize, param_types: &[(TempId, IrType)], mgr: &mut RegisterPressureManager, naming: &mut NameGenerator) -> (Vec<AsmInst>, Reg, Option<Reg>) }

Replace the body with logic that:
‚Ä¢ Models each param in words: scalar = 1, fat ptr = 2.
‚Ä¢ Packs up to 4 words into A0..A3 left-to-right; remainder go on the stack.
‚Ä¢ Computes stack offsets relative to FP using the saved area size (6 words: RA, FP, S0..S3).
‚Ä¢ Loads fat pointers on stack as addr (low word) at FP-‚Ä¶ then bank (high word) at FP-‚Ä¶+1.
‚Ä¢ For register-resident params, move from A-regs into temps immediately; never read A0..A3 again inside the callee.
‚Ä¢ When loading a fat pointer (reg or stack), record its bank register in your RegisterPressureManager (so later GEP sees the bank as BankInfo::Register(reg)).

Pseudo-outline (drop this into the function body, adjusting names if your API differs):

// classify params into 1- or 2-word items
// decide A0..A3 packing (4 words budget)
// build list of stack params (left->right), compute FP-relative offsets:
// FP-1 = nearest stack word, then walk downward
// convention for fat ptr on stack: [addr][bank] (low then high)
// load scalars/fat-ptrs accordingly:
// - reg params: MOV from A-regs to temps
// - stack params: compute FP+offset into SC, then LOAD
// record BankInfo::Register(bank_reg) for fat pointer temps

If helpful, I can supply a full ready-to-paste implementation matching your types; the core is as above.

2. Caller: push fat pointers as ‚Äúaddr then bank‚Äù

File: where you lower calls (often instruction.rs or builder.rs, the part that emits STORE ‚Ä¶; ADDI SP, SP, 1 for stack args).

Two rules to enforce:
‚Ä¢ Packing rule (registers): treat A0..A3 as a 4-word window packed left-to-right. Each scalar consumes 1 word; each fat pointer consumes 2 contiguous words (addr then bank). Overflow goes to the stack.
‚Ä¢ Stack layout rule: push right-to-left, and for each fat pointer pushed, emit:

; fat ptr on stack ‚Äî NEW order
STORE <addr>, SB, SP
ADDI SP, SP, 1
STORE <bank>, SB, SP
ADDI SP, SP, 1

Do not push bank first. The callee now expects addr at the lower address and bank at +1.

If your caller already follows this, great‚Äîjust confirm the order. If it pushes bank then addr, flip it.

3. (Optional but wise) Codify ‚Äúsave-once‚Äù in the callee

File: function.rs (parameter binding loop)

Right after you call load_param and add the emitted instructions, add a brief comment/reminder:

// From here, never read A0..A3 directly in this function;
// load_param moved all register params into temps.

load_param should already move from A-regs into S-temps or locals; this note prevents accidental reuse.

‚∏ª

Why this fixes your four test variants
‚Ä¢ minimal_insert(list, &dummy, 1, 'X')
Two fat-ptr words (list + dummy) consume A0..A3; scalars spill. The callee now loads pos/ch from correct FP offsets, so list[0] is untouched and list[1] becomes 'X'.
‚Ä¢ minimal_insert2(list, 1, 'X') and minimal_insert3(list, 'X')
Scalars in registers. The callee immediately moves them from A-regs to temps, so later code cannot clobber A-regs and smear values into your frame.
‚Ä¢ minimal_insert4(list)
Still works; nothing to fetch beyond the fat pointer.

‚∏ª

Sanity checks you can run

1. Build your four-function test again. Expect:

AB -> after minimal_insert -> AX

for the 2-char list demo. 2. Disassemble the callee: you should see
‚Ä¢ For 4-arg version: LOAD for pos and ch from FP-‚Ä¶ offsets (no fixed -7/-8),
‚Ä¢ For 3- and 2-arg versions: MOVE from appropriate A-regs into S-regs/temps at the top of the callee. 3. Grep the call site when arguments overflow: the two STORE lines for a fat pointer must be addr first, then bank.

‚∏ª

If you want me to wire in the exact code for load_param and the exact push sequence in your call-lowering function with concrete AsmInst lines, paste the snippets of those two spots and I‚Äôll hand you a drop-in patch tailored to your names and types.

# Generalized Macro Expander - Summary

## What We've Built

### 1. Prototype Implementation

- Created a working prototype that can expand macros to assembly language
- Reuses the existing MacroExpanderV3 as the core engine
- Assembly backend that converts expanded nodes to assembly syntax

### 2. MacroExpanderV4 Design

- Complete architecture for a backend-agnostic macro expander
- AST-preserving expansion pipeline
- Proper whitespace and newline handling
- Meta-programming features designed (but need parser updates to fully work)

### 3. Test Suite

- Comprehensive tests showing how macros can target assembly
- Examples of register allocation, loops, conditionals
- Demonstrates the potential of the approach

## Key Achievements

1. **Proved the concept** - The same macro language can target different backends
2. **Identified limitations** - Current parser treats `$` as BF command, making meta-variables challenging
3. **Created clean architecture** - Backend interface allows easy addition of new targets

## How to Use (Current Implementation)

```typescript
import { GeneralizedMacroExpander } from "./generalized-expander.ts";
import { AssemblyBackend } from "./assembly-backend.ts";

const backend = new AssemblyBackend();
const expander = GeneralizedMacroExpander.createWithBackend(backend);

const result = expander.expandWithBackend(`
  #define inc(reg) ADDI reg, reg, 1
  @inc(R3)
`);

console.log(result.output); // "ADDI R3, R3, 1"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Parser Enhancement** - Add support for meta-variable syntax that doesn't conflict with BF
2. **Complete V4** - Finish the V4 implementation with full meta-programming
3. **More Backends** - Add support for other targets (x86, LLVM IR, WebAssembly, etc.)
4. **Optimization** - Backend-specific optimizations and transformations

## Meta-Programming Vision

When complete, V4 will support:

```macro
#define for_each(items, body) {
  __LOCAL__ index = 0
  __LABEL__(loop_start):
  {if(index < __LENGTH__(items), {
    __LET__ item = items[index]
    body
    __SET__ index = index + 1
    __GOTO__ __LABEL__(loop_start)
  }, {})}
}

@for_each({R1, R2, R3}, {
  PUSH item
})
```

This would generate unique labels and proper iteration for any backend.

# Brainfuck Macro Expander - Rust Implementation

A Rust implementation of the Brainfuck macro expansion system, compatible with the TypeScript version used in the Brainfuck IDE.

## Features

‚úÖ **Core Functionality**

- Macro definitions and invocations with `#define` and `@`/`#` prefixes
- Parameter substitution in macros
- Single-line and multiline macro definitions
- Backslash line continuation for macros

‚úÖ **Builtin Functions**

- `{repeat(n, content)}` - Repeats content n times
- `{if(condition, true_branch, false_branch)}` - Conditional expansion
- `{for(var in array, body)}` - Iteration over arrays
- `{reverse(array)}` - Reverses array elements

‚úÖ **Advanced Features**

- Nested macro invocations
- Array literals `{1, 2, 3}`
- Character literals `'A'`
- Hexadecimal numbers `0xFF`
- Source map generation
- Circular dependency detection
- Comment handling

‚úÖ **CLI Tool**

```bash
# Expand a file
bfm expand input.bfm

# List all macros in a file
bfm list input.bfm

# Validate macro definitions
bfm validate input.bfm
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Token Recognition

The lexer recognizes builtin functions as single tokens (e.g., `{repeat` instead of `{` and `repeat`), matching the TypeScript implementation's behavior.

### Macro Body Parsing

- Single-line macros: `#define NAME content`
- Brace-delimited macros: `#define NAME {content}` (braces are delimiters, not part of content)
- Multiline macros: Starting with `{` on a new line after the macro name

### Expression Parsing

The expression parser handles:

- Whitespace and newlines within argument lists
- Comments within expressions
- Nested parentheses and braces
- Array literals and builtin functions

## Testing

Successfully expands complex real-world files like `cpu.bfm` (875KB output).

```bash
cargo test  # Run test suite
cargo run -- expand cpu.bfm > output.bf  # Expand large file
```

## Known Limitations

- Comment preservation in some edge cases
- Complex nested for loops with tuple destructuring (3+ variables)

## Building

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build (recommended for large files)
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## WASM Support

The library includes WASM bindings for browser integration:

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

## License

Part of the Brainfuck IDE project.

# Generalized Macro Expander R&D

This folder contains research and development work on generalizing the Brainfuck macro expander to support multiple backend languages, starting with Ripple Assembly.

## Current Status

### Working Prototype

- ‚úÖ Basic macro expansion to assembly
- ‚úÖ Preserves spaces in assembly instructions
- ‚úÖ Handles `repeat`, `if` builtins
- ‚úÖ Backend interface design
- ‚úÖ Assembly backend implementation

### V4 Development

- ‚úÖ Created MacroExpanderV4 with improved architecture
- ‚úÖ AST-preserving expansion pipeline
- ‚úÖ Meta-programming support (design complete)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Meta-variables (`$INVOC_COUNT`, `$LABEL()`) need parser updates

### Known Issues

1. The current parser treats `$` as a Brainfuck command, making meta-variables difficult
2. Spaces are stripped in curly brace contexts without quotes
3. Full `for` loop implementation pending

## Concept

The core idea is that the macro language itself (with `#define`, `@invocation`, `{repeat}`, `{if}`, `{for}`, etc.) is already backend-agnostic. We can reuse the same parsing and expansion logic but generate different output languages.

```
Input (Macro Language) ‚Üí Parse ‚Üí Expand ‚Üí Backend Generator ‚Üí Output (Target Language)
```

## Current Architecture

The existing macro expander:

1. Parses macro definitions and invocations
2. Expands them recursively
3. Outputs Brainfuck commands

## Proposed Architecture

```typescript
interface MacroBackend {
  name: string;
  generate(expandedAST: ASTNode[]): string;
  builtins?: Map<string, BuiltinFunction>;
  validate?(nodes: ASTNode[]): ValidationError[];
}
```

## Files in this Directory

- `macro-to-assembly.test.ts` - Test cases exploring macro expansion to assembly
- `console-example.ts` - Runnable examples demonstrating the concept
- `generalized-expander-design.ts` - Design document with interfaces and implementation ideas

## Key Insights

1. **The macro language is already generic** - It doesn't assume Brainfuck semantics
2. **Builtins are portable** - `repeat`, `if`, `for` work for any imperative language
3. **Backend-specific features** - Can be added through custom builtins
4. **Source maps work** - The expansion tracking remains the same

## Example: Same Macro, Different Backends

```macro
#define clear(n) {repeat(n, [-]>)}
@clear(5)
```

**Brainfuck output:**

```bf
[-]>[-]>[-]>[-]>[-]>
```

**Assembly output:**

```asm
LI R3, 0
ADDI R4, R4, 1
LI R3, 0
ADDI R4, R4, 1
; ... repeated 5 times
```

## Next Steps

1. Extract the AST types and parser into a shared module
2. Create a backend interface
3. Implement BrainfuckBackend (refactor existing code)
4. Implement RippleAssemblyBackend
5. Add backend-specific builtins and optimizations

## Benefits

- Write macros once, target multiple platforms
- Reuse complex macro logic across languages
- Enable cross-compilation scenarios
- Support mixed-language projects

# Assembly Editor TODO

## Features to Implement

1. **Autocomplete** - Implement autocomplete functionality for assembly instructions and labels

2. **Error Highlighting** - Use the same error highlighting style as the macro editor

3. **BF Output Panel** - Make the BF Output panel the first and main panel in the assembly editor output

4. **Persist Last Opened Panel** - Remember and restore the last opened panel in the assembly editor
